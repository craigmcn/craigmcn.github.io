I managed to get out to see [Little Miss Higgins](http://www.littlemisshiggins.com/) last night at [Amigo&#8217;s](http://www.amigoscantina.com/). The crowd was small, but definitely enthusiastic, so I think it worked out. She was selling CDs and offering to sign them, but at $20 for one or $30 for two, being unemployed, I couldn&#8217;t afford it. üôÅ

Anyhoo, what a great show. She even got some solid audience partcipation during the reprise of the brand new _Bargain Shop Panties_ and during another tune, whose name escapes me.

I noted within the first few tunes that the country blues she plays would go well with the [Rosebuds Wild West Show](http://www.rosebudburlesque.com/shows.htm) tonight and tomorrow (sold out, sorry, I don&#8217;t get to go either). Little Miss Higgins&#8217; music&#8217;s a little bit raunchy, honky tonk and super fun. Next time she comes your way, give her a listen!
