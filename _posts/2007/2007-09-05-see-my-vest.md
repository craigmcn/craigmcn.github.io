I&#8217;m not sure what brought this to mind, but, man, I love it!

> **See My Vest
  
> &#8212; a song from [The Simpsons](http://www.thesimpsons.com/), sung by [C. Montgomery Burns](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Charles_Montgomery_Burns)
  
>** _(to the tune of_ Be Our Guest _from Disney&#8217;s_ [Beauty and the Beast](http://www.beautyandthebeast.com/)_)_**
  
>** 
  
>  _Burns:_ Some men hunt for sport,
  
> Others hunt for food,
  
> The only thing I&#8217;m hunting for,
  
> Is an outfit that looks good&#8230;
> 
> See my vest, see my vest,
  
> Made from real gorilla chest,
  
> Feel this sweater, there&#8217;s no better,
  
> Than authentic Irish setter.
> 
> See this hat, &#8217;twas my cat,
  
> My evening wear &#8211; vampire bat,
  
> These white slippers are albino
  
> African endangered rhino.
> 
> Grizzly bear underwear,
  
> Turtles&#8217; necks, I&#8217;ve got my share,
  
> Beret of poodle, on my noodle
  
> It shall rest,
> 
> Try my red robin suit,
  
> It comes one breast or two,
  
> See my vest, see my vest,
  
> See my vest.
> 
> Like my loafers? Former gophers &#8211;
  
> It was that or skin my chauffeurs,
  
> But a greyhound fur tuxedo
  
> Would be best,
> 
> So let&#8217;s prepare these dogs,
  
>  _Mrs. Potts:_ Kill two for matching clogs,
  
>  _Burns:_ See my vest, see my vest,
  
> Oh please, won&#8217;t you see my vest
