Firstly, I would like to apologize, especially to Gwildor, about my <a href="/cyberbullying.html" target="_blank">insensitive comments</a> about bullying. I stand by my position that cyberbullying is ridiculous; I really suggest to get out and do your bullying in person. And, if you&#8217;re the one being bullied, stand up for yourself, as best you can.

Now on to more pleasant (?) things &#8230; There is a big thunderstorm outside right now, with really cool lightning. I&#8217;m really fascinated by lightning, soÂ I was interested to see some lightning that did not seem to result in thunder. I was always under the impression that thunder was produced when the lightning hit the ground, and that it was the resulting shockwave. From what I have <a href="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/primer/lightning/ltg_basics.html" target="_blank">read</a>, that does not seem to be the case&#8230; I also found <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=cool+lightning+pictures&hl=en&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=494rUPbwO6vqiwKXjYH4BA&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&biw=1264&bih=871" target="_blank">some cool lightning pictures</a>.
