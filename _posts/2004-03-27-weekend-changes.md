Just a quick note about a couple of changes this weekend&#8230;
  
First, I&#8217;ve cleaned up the menu a bit and added some links to the menu. The original &#8216;Links&#8217; menu item has now been renamed to &#8216;More Links&#8217; within the &#8216;Links&#8217; menu. You&#8217;ll see the <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/paulwells" target="_blank">Inkless Wells</a> link, as well as Gwildor&#8217;s Lopht and Wublub, both good dudes with excellent sites! Wublub has a solid &#8216;Rants&#8217; section!

And just for ol&#8217; gwildor himself, the Washington Capitals statistics section has been significantly upgraded to allow for all NHL teams&#8217; stats to be displayed.

Enjoy!
