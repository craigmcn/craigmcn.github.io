Sorry, this is now getting a little late, and it might have spoilers, but I figured I&#8217;d say my piece about the new TV season. My comments generally apply to the first episode, but may apply to the second episode, as well.

[**Bionic Woman**](http://www.nbc.com/Bionic_Woman/) (season 1) &#8211; Ch-ch-ch-ch, ch-ch-ch-ch &#8230; yup, a new [Jaime Sommers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Sommers_%28Bionic_Woman%29). While the second episode is available, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to watch, but the pilot was pretty good. Already we got the &#8220;How I became Bionic Woman&#8221; story and an arch-nemesis has been introduced.  It looks pretty good, but I&#8217;ll wait a couple of episodes before passing final judgement.

**[Bones](http://www.fox.com/bones/)** (season 3) &#8211; really just another episode; a cool, creepy episode, but just another episode. Not that I&#8217;m complaining. I like the show and there was nothing here to end that. It was a good beginning to the new season; no new characters and some resolution to existing issues. In fact, having finally read a Kathy Reichs book, I find that I like the Tempe Brennan from TV better.

**[CSI](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/)** (season 8) &#8211; good, but could&#8217;ve been better. Given the ordeal that Nick went through at the end of season 5, I think Sara (and Grissom) got off a little easily. I think there could&#8217;ve been more fancy lab work and more cold trails.

**[CSI: Miami](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_miami/)** (season 6) &#8211; Since last season didn&#8217;t end in a cliffhanger, I wasn&#8217;t expecting much more than a regular episode, but this one had a bit of a twist involving Horatio&#8217;s son. Now that I&#8217;ve seen episode 3, I think  Kyle will figure a little more prominently in the show. It&#8217;s always nice to have a season start with something new that can run through the rest of the season.

**[CSI:NY](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/)** (season 4) &#8211; As with _Miami_, I wasn&#8217;t expecting anything other than a good, dark _NY_ episode. And I got one. Lots of spilled blood, the Statue of Liberty and a weird serial killer. I&#8217;m waiting to find out what happens with Mac and his early morning phone calls.

**[Dexter](http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/)** (season 2) &#8211; wow, weird. While we finish off the whole storyline with Paul, the ex-husband (which is good, &#8217;cause Paul&#8217;s an asshole), we find Dexter entirely off his game (interesting, but disconcerting). Although Doakes seems to be realizing that his suspicions about Dexter may be unfounded, Dexter&#8217;s secrets aren&#8217;t so secret anymore. What&#8217;s gonna happen? Let&#8217;s wait and see&#8230;.

**[Dirty Sexy Money](http://www.tv.com/shows/dirty-sexy-money/)** (season1) &#8211; not impressed. Sorry. I like [Peter Krause](http://imdb.com/name/nm0470244/) and [Donald Sutherland](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000661/), and [Samaire Armstrong](http://imdb.com/name/nm1027847/) and [Zoe McLellan](http://imdb.com/name/nm0572721/) are hot, but that&#8217;s not enough. The acting was good and the story was good, but I don&#8217;t think I can put up with the characters for very long. Rich bastards being rich and bastard-y, how much fun is that?

**[Grey&#8217;s Anatomy](http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/index)** (season 3) &#8211; again, a guilty pleasure. I&#8217;m not a big fan of Meredith Grey, but I like George, Christina, Izzy and Callie. I think there&#8217;s been some good progression in storylines and character development over the series. This new season starts with some new stories and potential character development. I have a weird crush on Callie Torres, and I&#8217;m pretty glad that George got over Meredith and hooked up with Callie, but Izzy&#8217;s super hot and super nice, so I&#8217;ll probably be happy with whatever turns up.

**[House](http://www.fox.com/house/)** (season 4) &#8211; good, really good. I&#8217;m really interested to see where this new concept goes. We&#8217;ve been accustomed to House working with a team and now we leave it all behind. Episode 2 has me excited, I like the concept of having a bunch of different teams of individuals each competing for a spot. It really keeps the story moving.

**[My Name is Earl](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/)** (season 3) &#8211; good times! Although I&#8217;m not sure where the show goes from here, now that Earl is in prison for 2 years.

**[NCIS](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/)** (season 5) &#8211; good closer to last season&#8217;s cliffhanger, but not a lot of promise for the new season. Episode 2 gives us more to work with, we&#8217;re back into some good, old fashioned crime fighting, with twists and turns.

**[Numb3rs](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/)** (season 4) &#8211; another clean-up from last season. I didn&#8217;t see any serious new potential, so we&#8217;ll have to see how things play out. I think that Colby will generally be accepted back into the team, that is, if he doesn&#8217;t choose to leave.

**[Reaper](http://www.tv.com/shows/reaper/)** (season 1) &#8211; fun. Lots of fun. Come on, a group of slackers with a mini-vac (a Dirt Devil, no less) take on a fire-throwing demon, what&#8217;s not to love? I think you&#8217;ll all want to check this one out, it should be a lot of fun.

**[Ugly Betty](http://www.tv.com/shows/ugly-betty/)** (season 2) &#8211; Big Cracker&#8217;s guilty pleasure. This dramedy (comedy-drama) is fun when it&#8217;s comedic, but gets a little too serious when it&#8217;s dramatic. For example, in the first episode of the season, there was a fun, happy scene running through the episode that ended really sad and pathetic. Fun, but then terrible. Not a show for everyone, but I&#8217;m willing to run with it for a second season.

I sure don&#8217;t have time to keep with 15 shows, but I&#8217;ll do my best. I didn&#8217;t mention [Weeds](http://www.sho.com/site/weeds/), even though the third season starts on [Showcase](http://www.showcase.ca/weeds/) tonight, since I&#8217;ve already seen most of it on [Showtime](http://www.sho.com/site/homepage/index.html). And I didn&#8217;t mention [The 4400](http://www.usanetwork.com/series/the4400/), since I&#8217;m still catching up with season 3 and the beginning of season 4. Plus, I&#8217;m sure something else&#8217;ll come up and I&#8217;ll have to watch it, too. Damn, what about [Corner Gas](http://www.cornergas.com/)? I&#8217;ll get to it, eventually.
