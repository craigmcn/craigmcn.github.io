This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Nothing Compares 2 U_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Compares_2_U) by [Sinéad O&#8217;Connor](http://sineadoconnor.com/), from her 1990 album, [I Do Not Want What I Haven&#8217;t Got](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Do_Not_Want_What_I_Haven%27t_Got). The [Chris Cornell](http://chriscornell.com/) version is from a 2015 appearance on [Sirius XM&#8217;s Artist Confidential](http://blog.siriusxm.com/2015/09/17/chris-cornell-joins-david-fricke-for-an-in-depth-interview-studio-performance/).

The song was originally written and composed by [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) for one of his side projects, [The Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Family_(band)), a funk band created as an outlet to release more of Prince&#8217;s music. Their eponymous, and only, album was released in 1985. O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s rendition reflected on her mother&#8217;s death in 1985.
