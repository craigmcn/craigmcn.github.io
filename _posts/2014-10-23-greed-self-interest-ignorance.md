A little while ago, I was a asked a quick question &#8220;aside from why is the world going to shit&#8221;. I believe I answered the quick question quickly, and my answer to the second part was: &#8220;The world is going to shit because of greed, self-interest and ignorance. Solve those, save the world.&#8221;

I felt pretty clever with my flippant response, but the more I think about it, I think it&#8217;s apt. I was just making a vague reference to &#8220;[Save the cheerleader, save the world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)#Promotions_and_fandom),&#8221; but I really got thinking about what it would take to solve the problem of the world going to hell in a handcart, as I like to phrase it.

I was going to try to tackle these issues in a four-part series, with this post just presenting some basic opinions I have in these areas, and then focusing on each one in its own post. But in the time it&#8217;s taken me to put my thoughts together, I&#8217;ve read a number of books, one of them being [Robert J. Sawyer](http://sfwriter.com/)&#8216;s [_Calculating God_](http://sfwriter.com/excg.htm). I&#8217;ve decided to embrace as a personal guiding principle an idea from the book: “…[learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace](http://sfwriter.com/blog/?p=2653)….” (There&#8217;s more context in the linked article.) And this guiding principle has made me realize that I can—and probably should—just ignore my thoughts on the world. And achieve some inner peace.

So rather than belabour the obvious fact that the world is going to hell, I&#8217;m suggesting that you should try to be the best you can be, and guide yourself in this endeavour by thinking of those who love you and depend on you, and I&#8217;ll try to do the same. Maybe if we can all do this, the world will go to hell slightly more slowly.
