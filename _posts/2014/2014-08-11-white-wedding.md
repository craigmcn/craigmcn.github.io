Because it was my brother&#8217;s wedding this past weekend, this week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is the questionably wedding themed, [_White Wedding_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Wedding_(song)), from [Billy Idol](http://www.billyidol.net/)&#8216;s 1982 [eponymous debut album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Idol_(album)). The cover is an acoustic version by [Queens of the Stone Age](http://www.qotsa.com/) from a 2009 live appearance on [Live105](http://live105.cbslocal.com/) in [San Francisco](http://www.sanfrancisco.com/). They also released the song on their 2007 album,Â [Era Vulgaris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_Vulgaris_(album)).
