[h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/) convinced me to go see a play last night. It&#8217;s called _Garden_ and is part of the [Summerworks](http://www.summerworks.ca/) theatre festival. h!&#8217;s friend Maev played the female lead, Diane. He was a little concerned that the &#8220;sexual content&#8221; and simulated sex scenes might involve nudity, but we were spared, for the most part. Diane&#8217;s husband, Jack, ends up in his jockey&#8217;s at the end, and it would have been classier had they actually been tighty-whiteys, or Homers as I&#8217;ve heard them called. But they were standard issue red Hanes&#8217;; decent, but not theatrical. An interesting story, excellent acting, some humourous dialogue and intriguing scenes. Well worth the $10.

I&#8217;ll probably try to catch _Other Places_ tonight, because the young woman handing out the flyers yesterday was rather attractive. Yup, that&#8217;s sometimes all it takes.
