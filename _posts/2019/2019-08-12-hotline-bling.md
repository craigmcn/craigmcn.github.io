This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Hotline Bling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Bling) by
[Drake](http://drakeofficial.com/) from his 2016 album,
[Views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_(album)), but released as a single in 2015. The [Daniela Andrade](https://www.danielaandrade.com/)
version is from a 2015 performance.

To be frank, I think the song is generally awful and Drake doesn’t make it better. Daniela Andrade’s version is good, but the content doesn’t fit her style.
