Man, it&#8217;s so nice to have the internet back in my house. I&#8217;m not so concerned about having a working phone, but I can&#8217;t live without the internet. If only to download all the TV that I miss by not having cable. My landlord said he&#8217;s completely switched over from [Bell](http://www.bell.ca/home/) to [Rogers](http://www.shoprogers.com/store/bundles/main.asp), but I also know that [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), although he has all of his services through Rogers, isn&#8217;t impressed with them.

So I&#8217;m torn. I&#8217;m happy with my very fast and unlimited-bandwidth Bell connection: it doesn&#8217;t block my bittorrent downloads or throttle my bandwidth at any point. But the home phone service is very expensive and adding on long distance makes it twice as expensive. I&#8217;m wary of moving my phone over to [Vonage](http://www.vonage.ca/), since if I lose my internet connection, I don&#8217;t have a phone. I&#8217;m [not too keen on Rogers](http://www.ihaterogers.ca/index.htm), but I could probably get a decent bundled package of internet, home phone and cable.

Any ideas?
