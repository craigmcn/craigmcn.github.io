I realize [it&#8217;s come and gone](http://www.1234567890day.com/), unnoticed and uncelebrated by me, and anyone I know, but I also realize that it&#8217;s somewhat momentous. Friday, February 13, 2009 5:31:30 pm CST expressed as a [UNIX](http://www.unix.org/) [timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) was 1234567890. It&#8217;s kinda dorky, but I think it&#8217;s an interesting representation of humanity. At once it&#8217;s highly arbitrary and yet interestingly sophisticated. [This video](http://revision3.com/content/1234567890/) explains it at least as well as I could.
