This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_If I Can’t Have You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I_Can%27t_Have_You_(Shawn_Mendes_song)) by
[Shawn Mendes](http://shawnmendesofficial.com/) from his 2018 album,
[Shawn Mendes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Mendes_(album)). The [Trevor Bragg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCklo2D-YdxppQwR7LxLo4ww)
version is from a 2020 performance.

I worked with Trevor in Toronto and I’ve really liked the covers he’s been posting lately. He’s put a bit of a classic rock spin on the vocals, which is totally his thing.
