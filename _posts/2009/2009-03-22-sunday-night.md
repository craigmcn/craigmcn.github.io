A bit of a nod to the [Bay City Rollers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBn2ux5vRHk). Anyhoo, I’m pretty disappointed that I was stood up for trivia night at the Yard and Flagon. I was doing pretty well by myself, while waiting for people to show, but not well enough, or having enough fun, to continue for two hours!

The Big B, who usually captains the good ship SS Trivia (or the [HMCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Canadian_Ship) Trivia, as my sister would call it), was stuck in [Edmonton](http://www.edmonton.ca/) due to a big snowstorm. Obviously, Big B is the only person with whom others will team up for trivia. As some of you may understand, I would normally take this as a personal insult and never show up for trivia night ever again. Well, this time, I’m going to try to take this as a simple inconvenient truth and come back for the next trivia night in two weeks, when Big B can join us.

I was all stoked for trivia, having won the Canadian trivia game we played at Sunday Night Family Dinner time, but ’twas not to be, alas. I ended up drinking three pints of [Traditional Ale](http://www.bigrockbeer.com/beer/traditional-ale) <del>(unfortunately a Flash site where I cannot link directly)</del>, mostly by myself. Thanks to Jonny B, who was killing time before the [Bonnie Prince Billy](http://www.myspace.com/bonnieprincebilly) show, for keeping me company for a bit.
