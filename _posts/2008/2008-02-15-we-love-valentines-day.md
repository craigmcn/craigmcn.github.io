Good times had by all yesterday at the Horseshoe Tavern for their Valentine&#8217;s Day rock fest. Wild Erbunch and his gang, We Love, played a solid set and rocked out with [SizzlyPoppa](http://myspace.com/sizzlypoppa) on drums. Generally the Sizzler doesn&#8217;t play with We Love, and generally We Love _don&#8217;t need no stinkin&#8217; drummer_, but it really made a difference and gave them a fuller, more complete sound.

To round out the night, we had Decade of Sleep (yeah, no website, shitty) and then [Mindsight](http://www.musicofmindsight.com/). (Then We Love.) Decade of Sleep were good; they did really well with the [Beatles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles) (_Helter Skelter_)Â and [Beastie Boys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys) (_Sabotage_) covers, but not so much with their original stuff. Mindsight was weird; with a sort of &#8217;90s metal/[Alexisonfire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexisonfire)/[Tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_(band)) vibe (while fun, not really up my alley, sorry).

Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day!
