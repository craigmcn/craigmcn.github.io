With the [iPad](http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad) having sold over 3 million units, [a new Kindle](http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/07/28/amazon-reveals-new-kindle-139-for-wi-fi-version/) coming out, [an Android tablet](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/07/velocity-cruz-android-tablet-7-inch-display-300/) coming out, and [Saskatchewan finally getting 3G+ coverage](http://www.sasktel.com/search/controller/_/Tab-4294966321/Ntt-3G-network), I&#8217;m excited to have all kinds of gadget options available to me. But what do I want?

I definitely want telephone, text message, and email capability, and all the smarty-phones have those. But what about calendar, tasks, and contacts that can sync to Google and [Remember the Milk](http://www.rememberthemilk.com)? And then I need to listen to music, read ebooks, and take halfway decent on-the-go pictures.

Oh yeah, and smaller than a regular 200-300 page paperback. With headphones that let me listen to music, alert me to an incoming phone call, and then let me take the call.

Does such a device exist? Will it ever? And will it cost me an arm and a leg?
