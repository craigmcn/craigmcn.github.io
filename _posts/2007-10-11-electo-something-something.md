So there was an [election here in Ontario](http://www.cbc.ca/ontariovotes2007/) yesterday. I wasn&#8217;t overly enthusiastic about it, so you didn&#8217;t hear any pre-election news from me. And now that it&#8217;s over, I&#8217;m still not enthusiastic, and I still don&#8217;t have much news.

We have the same, marginally competent, majority government as before the election. And the same (stupid) first-past-the-post electoral system as before the referendum.

Another election and nothing has changed. Nor do I expect it to.
