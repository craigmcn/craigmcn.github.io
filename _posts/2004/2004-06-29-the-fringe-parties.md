Well, it&#8217;s all over. Paul Martin remains Prime Minister, Stephen Harper remains in Opposition. All parties, including the independent, won seats on the backs of the Liberals. The Bloc Québécois and the NDP, as well as the fringe parties, got significantly higher percentages of the votes (as compared to 2000), while both the Liberals and Conservatives got less. I don&#8217;t think this was a clear representation of voter opinion, but a minority government is definitely an indictment of past performance. Since the NDP and Liberals together don&#8217;t make up a majority, and the independent being a former Reform/Aliiance member, this is definitely a weak minority. But if Martin can consistently garner support from the Bloc on major bills, I think this can be the most succesful minority government this country has seen.
