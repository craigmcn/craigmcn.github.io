Big thanks to [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com), Trikie and Nutmeg for hosting a great barbeque last night. Special mention to Sprocket and Boobers for not being complete pains in the ass the whole time. And second special mention to M and Chuck D for giving me a lift to the subway. I guess [Smokey](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) deserves a mention for having forgotten the giant, music-filled hard drive for Chuck D that resulted in them needing to drive all the way downtown to get it. And further mention to A and M for the DE-licious [pierogi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierogi)!
