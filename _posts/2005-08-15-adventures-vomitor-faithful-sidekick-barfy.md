I&#8217;ll warn you in advance that this is going to be long, and I apologize. On that note, let&#8217;s begin. Although this is not the longest I&#8217;ve gone between blogs—I don&#8217;t think, and I&#8217;m not going to check—it&#8217;s usually because I&#8217;m a lazy jackass, but you all know that already.This time I have a good reason: I&#8217;ve been on vacation for the past week. <span style="font-style: italic;">Yay</span>! I spent 4 days on [Vancouver Island](http://www.vancouverisland.com/) and 3 days in suburban [Seattle](http://www.seeseattle.com/) (well, [Edmonds, WA](http://www.edmondswa.com/) in [Snohomish County](http://www.snohomish.org/) <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> part of Greater Seattle).

My mom, stepdad, stepsister and her partner, stepbrother, sister, niece and I had a [gorgeous house](http://www.naluhouse.com/) <del>(<span style="font-style: italic;">you&#8217;ll have to click on Suites, then Nalu House &#8230; damn frames!</span>)</del> in [Tofino](http://www.gotofino.com/).There were 4 spectacular days of walks on the beach, a bucketload of hanging out, and even a bike ride on the beach with my stepsister and niece. And I can&#8217;t forget the event that led to the [slightly] cryptic title of this blog &#8230; a whale watching tour.

Two and a half hours becomes an eternity when you&#8217;re seasick! My sister had the heaves almost as soon as we left the dock, but never actually blew chunks. We got to the whale watching area where my stepdad, stepsister, stepbrother and I went out on deck to get a better look. Well, that set my stepsister off and she <span style="font-weight: bold;">spewed</span> enough to fill a small <span style="font-weight: bold;">barf</span> bag. I was okay for the moment, so I went back inside to sit down while we headed off to see some [Steller sea lions](http://www.vanaqua.org/learn/aquafacts/otters-and-pinnipeds/steller-sea-lions). I started feeling crappy then, so I put my head down and closed my eyes. When we got to the sea lions&#8217; island, I opened my eyes and pretty much <span style="font-weight: bold;">hurled</span> right then and there. Thankfully, I managed to get a garbage bag under me to catch the <span style="font-weight: bold;">chunder</span>! That&#8217;s how I earned the nickname Vomitor from my stepbro! And I&#8217;m not sure whether Barfy is my stepsister or my niece, but my niece was next to <span style="font-weight: bold;">fertilize the sidewalk</span>. My stepsister&#8217;s partner was ill, but was up on the top deck, so seemed able to contain her <span style="font-weight: bold;">gack</span>. My niece even asked the tour operator whether this was normal behaviour (which it turned out to be), since she didn&#8217;t want us to be known as the Barf Family.

Overall though, we had a great time. Excellent dinners of salmon and pasta, homemade burgers and barbequed ribs. Mmmmm&#8230;. reeebs! And one evening, us kids sat down for a viewing of [Valley Girl](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086525/).

My sister moved to Edmonds, Wa the day before I headed out west. My mom and stepdad had moved into a condo from a large house and had extra furniture they gave to my sister. So my mom, stepdad, sister, niece and I drove on down to Edmonds (just north of Seattle). We moved the furniture in, went down to Renton (south of Seattle) to the [IKEA](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/store/seattle), and just basically hung out together. It was really nice.

Yeah, so, that&#8217;s it, boys and girls. The Big Cracker&#8217;s vacation summer 2005 to the Left Coast! It got me thinking about some major life changes &#8230;maybe a move to [Saskatchewan](http://www.sasktourism.com/) (maybe even to [Beatty](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=beatty,+sk&spn=0.023560,0.060176&hl=en) (yup, the intersection of 3 and 368) and help Wublub and Gonch with the [greenhouse](http://www.wrightsgreenhouse.com/) and start a coffee shop/internet café) to become a freelance web developer. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s time to get away from the [Big Smoke](http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2003-07-17/news_story6.php) and the corporate mess I work in. (Sorry, Daddy-O, I&#8217;m leaving the preposition at the end of that clause.)
