Further to [yesterday’s post](minimalism-simplicity-moderation.html), over the last year or so, I’ve been keeping an eye on the domain [Polonius.com](http://www.whois.net/whois/polonius.com). I was thinking that I wanted to start a minimalism, simplicity, and productivity blog, and [Polonius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonius) provided sage advice. Unfortunately, the domain is still not available.

But on further reflection, all I would’ve done is reposted or quoted from existing sites, like [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/), [WorkAwesome](http://workawesome.com/), [Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/), and others. So I decided that I would just try to keep you all updated on my minimalism, simplicity, and productivity efforts.

I’ve already begun a few things:

  * Using [Typingweb.com](http://www.typingweb.com/) to improve my typing speed and ability.
  * Using the [TimeLeft](http://www.timeleft.info/) timer to keep me focused on tasks.
  * Using [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com/) to keep track of personal tasks, and [Outlook](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/) for work tasks.  
    (In fact, I’m looking to update our [Sharepoint](http://sharepoint.microsoft.com/) project list to synchronize tasks in Outlook.)
  * Updating this site’s design to something slightly more minimal.
  * Automating more computer-related tasks (e.g., backups, updates).

What else should I be working on?
