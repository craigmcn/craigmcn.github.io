Smokey sent me an invite to hook up on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/), so I did. It&#8217;s kinda cool, but I&#8217;m gonna keep using my [NowPlaying Winamp plug-in](http://www.winamp.com/plugin/now-playing/138883) for now. Last.fm has some data feeds built in, but then I&#8217;d have to figure out how to implement themâ€”maybe another time. Anyway, there&#8217;s a Last.fm logo under my Now/Recently Playing info that&#8217;ll pop you into the website and you can see what&#8217;s going with my music listening. I&#8217;m not sure how useful it&#8217;ll be, since I usually just listen to a play list of about 3000 tunes that run the gamut from [Avril Lavigne](http://www.avrillavigne.com/), [AC/DC](http://www.acdcrocks.com/) and [ABBA](http://www.abbasite.com/) to [ZZ Top](http://www.zztop.com/) and [Zamfir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gheorghe_Zamfir). I&#8217;m not sure Last.fm&#8217;ll be able to figure out my music listening styles.
