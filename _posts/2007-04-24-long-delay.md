I know you guys wait with bated breath for my next post; I apologize for the delay. I&#8217;ve had a number of blogs on the go and now they&#8217;re all posted, back-dated over the past week. I&#8217;ve had some things on my mind recently, of which some of you may be somewhat aware (and now that old blogs are posted, all of you should be aware).

I&#8217;m thinking of buying a house in [Saskatoon](http://www.saskatoon.ca/QUICK%20FACTS/Pages/Quick%20Facts.aspx). My plan is to pick it up soon, to beat the current upward trend of the market, and my sister will live there until I eventually move back (which is inevitable, but the timing indefinite). In fact, depending on the house I can get (i.e., afford), it may be big enough for all of us at the same time. Convenient.
