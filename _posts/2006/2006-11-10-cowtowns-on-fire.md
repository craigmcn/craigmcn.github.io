After a fairly uneventful, but waay too early flight, I&#8217;m in beautiful, snowy [Calgary](http://www.tourismcalgary.com/), [Alberta](http://www.discoveralberta.com/). When the plane was landing, I assumed we were either above or in the clouds, since everything was white. But then we bumped on something so I looked out again: we were on the ground, the cold, snow-covered ground.

I grabbed some lunch with Yateser then fought through the traffic to head over to Yateser&#8217;s house, where I&#8217;m staying 2 nights. I went for a short stroll around downtown, which looks a lot better than it did. They&#8217;ve done a lot of gentrification, at least on the façades. A quick stop into [Chinook Centre](http://www.chinookcentre.com/en/Pages/default.aspx) mall, which was no great shakes, it&#8217;s a mall like any other. I didn&#8217;t find what I was looking for.

And Yateser scored tickets to a [Calgary Flames hockey game](http://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/200611100CGY.html). So we headed over to the [Pengrowth Saddledome](http://www.where.ca/calgary/guide_listing~listing_id~801.htm) for some awesome NHL action. I met a couple of Yateser&#8217;s colleagues and drank some beers.

Now it&#8217;s late, and time for bed. Nighty night!
