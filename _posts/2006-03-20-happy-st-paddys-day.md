    Anyway &#8230; I was a little too drunk to discuss the night when I got home Friday, and a little too hungover Saturday to actually post anything then. So, I&#8217;m finally writing it Monday morning.

    What a gong show! I went down to <a href="http://www.primepubs.com/#/whats-on/?id=119">Fionn MacCool&#8217;s</a>, obviously an Irish place. I&#8217;d been warned that if I wanted to get in, I should show up by about 2pm. Well, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I work for a living and didn&#8217;t get down to the bar until 6pm. I waited for 45 minutes in line, in the howling wind and biting cold until I was allowed into the pre-bar beer tent. This was an unheated tent beside the bar where an attractive yet utterly frozen young lady was serving ice cold beers. So, not only did I not get to warm up in the tent, I was able to start freezing myself from the inside! I had to take a number to get into the bar. My number was 78 while they were at about 35. Some people left and I managed to trade up to number 51, at the same time, it turned out most of the people in the 40s had already left. Within 20 minutes (and a nursed pint of <a href="http://www.diageo.com/en-row/ourbrands/categories/Pages/Beers.aspx#harp">Harp</a>), I was finally allowed into the bar!

    It was a special time. I met up with my old roommate, Tigerrage, and his friends and I proceeded to have more beers, <a href="http://www.thebeerstore.ca/beers/smithwicks-ale">Smithwick&#8217;s</a> mostly, and get loaded. I stumbled home, had a surreal chat with some dude on the streetcar on the way, and spent Saturday straightening myself out.

    <a href="http://www.ppfhouse.com/art.php">h! is for hulk</a> blew off our plan to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/">V for Vendetta</a>, and I still haven&#8217;t gotten out to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/">Ultraviolet</a>, so maybe I&#8217;ll try again this week.
