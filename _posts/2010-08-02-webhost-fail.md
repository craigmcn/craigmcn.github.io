I&#8217;m not sure how many of you noticed, but the website was up and down over the last few days. Many of my other sites experienced the same fate, or worse.

My excellent webhost choose to advise me Thursday that they would be migrating my server Friday morning. They also assured me that the downtime would be minimal. They failed, however, to advise me that database connectivity would take several days to resolve, and that I would have to do it myself.

Because pretty much all of my sites depend on databases to some degree, all of them had problems. Some only failed to have content on some pages, while others couldn&#8217;t even load. My apologies to everyone affected.

Thanks again, [Netfirms](http://www.netfirms.com/), for terrible service! I wish I wasn&#8217;t locked into a 2-year contract! (Well, I guess I&#8217;m not locked, but it&#8217;s not really worth the money to switch right now.)
