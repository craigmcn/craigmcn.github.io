So, 3 more work days on the phones and I have now realized a 2<sup>nd</sup> important fact. Not only does it frustrate me that I can&#8217;t get any other work done while on the phones, I can&#8217;t get any work done when I get away from the phones either. It sucks the life out of me!

I got a couple of gorgeous Photoshop files from which to create a new page for a website, but do you think I could focus long enough to do what I actually needed to do? No, of course not. For the time being, I&#8217;ve simply converted the files to jpegs and published them. It doesn&#8217;t look horrible, but it&#8217;s certainly not what I had originally planned.

All I want to do when I get home is [watch TV](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/), [play video games](http://www.2kgames.com/pirates/pc/home.php) and [read for a bit](http://www.amazon.ca/Oryx-Crake-MARGARET-ATWOOD/dp/0747562598/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1347048968&sr=1-6) before flopping heavily into bed. And then I don&#8217;t want to get up. And when I inevitably get up, I don&#8217;t want to go to work. And when I&#8217;m at work, I just want to go home. &#8230; 3 more days &#8230;
