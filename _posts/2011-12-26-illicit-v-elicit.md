As I was writing [my Muppets post](/review-the-muppets.html "Review: The Muppets"), I used the word [illicit](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/illicit "Definition: illicit") and realized that it means something very different from what I intended, [elicit](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/elicit "Definition: elicit"). I quickly corrected the word, but not before writing it and potentially looking the fool.

For your own reference:

> illicit (il·lic·it [ih-lis-it]) adjective
> 1. not legally permitted or authorized; unlicensed; unlawful.
> 2. disapproved of or not permitted for moral or ethical reasons.
> 
> elicit (e·lic·it [ih-lis-it]) verb (used with object)
> to draw or bring out or forth; educe; evoke: _to elicit the truth; to elicit a response with a question._

I think I may try to come up with some short lesson like this once a week. Not exactly a word-of-the-day or -week, but more of a correction or clarification of the week.
