Okay, I&#8217;ve started this blog 4 times and obviously never quite finished it. It was supposed to be done Monday morning, but, as they say, shit happens. Anywho, I finally had a [breakfast sandwich](http://www.timhortons.com/en/menu/breakfast-sandwich.html) from [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/). Not bad. Not great either. I had the sausage one. It was a sausage &#8216;n&#8217; egg sandwich; nothing to write home about—except here I am writing. I had a problem with the tea biscuit. To steal a phrase from [Star Trek](http://www.startrek.com/), it began losing structural integrity and I need to re-route power to the containment field. Translation: it started falling apart, so I had to hold it funny. The English muffin, croissant and bun approaches definitely work better. I didn&#8217;t find it too salty, as I&#8217;ve heard other people say, but it was kind of expensive, $2.49 for a sandwich is a little pricey.
