I&#8217;m going to try some themed posts for a little while. [My sister](http://lauramcnaughton.wordpress.com/) has Poetry Wednesday and Friday&#8217;s Essay, so I thought I might try something myself. I&#8217;ve had fun the last few days posting music videos and I always like CBC Radio 2 Morning&#8217;s [Under the Covers](http://music.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2012/3/Under-the-Covers-Seeking-your-favourite-awesome-cover-songs) feature, thus my feature: Music Monday.

This week&#8217;s, and the debut, instalment is _Rusty Cage_. The 1991 original by [Soundgarden](http://www.soundgardenworld.com/) is the third single from their third studio album (but, I would argue, their first mainstream success), [Badmotorfinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badmotorfinger).

The cover is from Johnny Cash&#8217;s 1996 album [Unchained](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unchained_(Johnny_Cash_album)), which features covers of [Beck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck), [Tom Petty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Petty) and [Dean Martin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Martin).

Without further ado, _Rusty Cage_:
