What a terrific movie. It was funny and nostalgic and had great celebrity cameos, as expected from a Muppet movie.

The story was perfect. The Muppets are all but forgotten entertainers, their theatre falling down, and the cast members all off on their own; some successful, others not so much. But with a young muppet hero who has adored the Muppets all his life, whose enthusiasm brings them back together.

My sister said it’s the first time in a long time that a movie has made her snort with laughter. And if not Fozzie’s fart shoes, Dave Grohl’s Animool impersonator, Jack Black’s unwilling and unwitting celebrity host, or Alan Arkin’s disaffected tour guide, there was definitely something to elicit a snort.

If you haven’t already, go see it, and take the kids. 9 out 10!
