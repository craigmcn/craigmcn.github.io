So I&#8217;m now back from [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/)&#8216;s place having tried my hand at the new [Nintendo Wii](http://wii.nintendo.com/). While I think Wii is easily the stupidest name for a game console I&#8217;ve ever heard, the experience was good times! It was such a unique form of gameplay, it was definitely a good experience. I played the [Wii Sports](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/1OTtO06SP7M52gi5m8pD6CnahbW8CzxE): tennis, baseball, bowling, golf and boxing. These 5 sports expose the player to the major points of the new gameplay style. In tennis, you need to swing the controller like a racket; in baseball, you need to swing the controller like a bat or like you&#8217;re throwing a ball; in bowling, you need to move the controller like your rolling the ball and release the controller button when you release the ball; in golf, the putting was kind of weird, but generally you need to move the controller like a golf club. The boxing was probably the most active. It requires the other half of the [nunchuk controller](http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what-is-wii#/controls/nunchuk). There&#8217;s another controller that attaches by way of a wire to the primary controller. The movement of the 2 parts together simulated your fists for punching your opponent.

I watched others play [Trauma Center](http://www.atlus.com/traumacenter/), a surgery &#8220;game&#8221;. (I don&#8217;t know how much surgery is a game, but in this case it was.) You&#8217;re a doctor and you have to use the contoller like a scalpel, or a laser, or a needle, or suction, or ultrasound. You point the controller at the screen and do surgery. Wild. The graphics leave a little to be desired, but Nintendo was not competing with the high-definition games of [Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox360/consoles) or [Playstation](http://www.us.playstation.com/PS3). I give Nintendo credit for delivering a new concept of video games, rather then just focusing on the visual content. Plus, [leo37](http://leo37.com/) created an avatar that looked eerily like me. 9 out of 10 saltines!
