This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Lost Together_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Together_(Blue_Rodeo_album) "Song") by
[Blue Rodeo](https://www.bluerodeo.com/) from their 1992 album,
[Lost Together](https://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/lost-together/ "Album"). The Blue Rodeo and Friends
version is from a 2012 performance for the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the band’s debut album.

Because it’s Canada Day and I wanted a Canadian song covered by Canadians. I think I won.
