Seriously, this blog is about killing spiders. I killed one at work yesterday and was severely chastised for it. &#8220;What!?! You killed a spider?&#8221; &#8220;Oh my god, you **can&#8217;t** kill spiders!&#8221; &#8220;Spiders kill and eat all the other bugs, they&#8217;re so helpful!&#8221; Yeah? Fuck off. In my house, in my garden, maybe spiders _are_ helpful. On my desk, on the 6th floor of an office building? No thanks. _You_ don&#8217;t want to kill spiders, fine, let &#8217;em run free. Me, I&#8217;m gonna kill &#8217;em.
