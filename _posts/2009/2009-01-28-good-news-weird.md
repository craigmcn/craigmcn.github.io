It&#8217;s been, like, 4 months that I&#8217;ve been looking for work and until last week had found maybe 3 jobs to apply for (and only 1 that resulted in an interview, and obviously did not get me the job). Within the last 8 days, I&#8217;ve found 6. None have resulted in an interview yet, but 3 in 4 months and 6 in 8 days? Something weird&#8217;s going on.
