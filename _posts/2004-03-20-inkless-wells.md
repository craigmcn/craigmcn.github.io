As you will now notice there is a link to [Inkless Wells](http://www.macleans.ca/paulwells), Paul Wells&#8217; Macleans.ca weblog, in the left-hand navigation menu. It took me awhile to sort out the necessary code to open the new window, since the menu is built using [PHP code](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp) and a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) database. And the menu is not actual hyperlinks to the pages, it is all Javascript &#8216;onClick&#8217; events for the table cells.

It sounds complicated, but once you sort out the _nuances_ of the different forms of code, it makes sense &#8230;. Well, it does to me anyway.

I&#8217;m still working on the MP3s, and in making them available on the site. Since I don&#8217;t want to have to load 2000 MP3s onto the server, I&#8217;m hoping to set-up a way for _registered users_ to request specific files and make those available for a set period of time. The request will send me an email to put the file on the server, then the user will get an email letting them know it&#8217;s available. Once the time period has passed, the file will not be available, and I will have a list of files that need to be removed from the server. Pretty wild, eh? Yeah, if I can ever get the logic sorted out!

Alrighty, well, time to put coffee on and start sorting out the 6 cu.ft. pile of papers and what-not all over my kitchen table&#8230; Take care!
