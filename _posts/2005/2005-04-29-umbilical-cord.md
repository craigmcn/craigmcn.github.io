Just a quick to anyone who cares &#8230; crackerMail v1.0.1 (RC2) is now available. It&#8217;s been ready for a while and I&#8217;ve been testing it myself, I just had to get off my ass and put it online. Enjoy!

I will leave you with a quote from Kirk Hammett, guitarist for Metallica: &#8220;My guitars are my umbilical cord. They&#8217;re directly wired into my head.&#8221; I would think that makes it difficult to make it through airport security &#8230;.
