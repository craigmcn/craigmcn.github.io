Hey, Hey! A weekend blog!

I had a fairly eventful weekend: out to the movies Friday and out for the (now ubiquitous) game night with <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and <a href="http://trikie.tripod.com/" target="_blank">Trikie</a>. Trikie&#8217;s sister, J, was out as was Trikie&#8217;s old buddy, Big A, aka The Big Stoner. I mean no offence to Big A, but, boy, that dude smokes a lot of dope.

We played a good game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_It%3F" target="_blank">Scene It?</a> I like the game, except everybody feels the need to stop me from winning all the time. In fact, that was part of the reason J was over, since she&#8217;s equally a movie genius and was guaranteed to give me a run for my money. We moved on to <a href="http://www.trivialpursuit.com/trivialpursuit/boardgames_dvd.html" target="_blank">Trivial Pursuit &#8211; DVD Pop Culture Edition</a>, and J won that, hands down. Almost everybody was getting runs of good questions that I knew the answers to, but when my turn came, no such luck. I may sound a bit whiny, and I am. If there&#8217;s games in the world that are suited to my intellectual specialties, they&#8217;re trivia games. My mind contains some of the most trivial (literally: small and unnecessary) facts known to mankind. I don&#8217;t know why. Finally, we moved onto <a href="http://www.catan.com/" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a>, after J went home. As always, it was a rivalry between Gwildor and Trikie (although nothing got thrown at anyone, this time), with Big A and I just doing the best we could. Trikie finally won after stealing Big A&#8217;s Longest Road.

So, back to Friday&#8217;s movie, the very acceptable <a title="Van Helsing" href="/van-helsing.html" target="_blank">Van Helsing</a>. Gwildor and Trikie seemed to think it was repetitive and dragged on, and it sort of did, but I think it told a good story. I called it “very acceptable”, not excellent or spectacular, again, it told a good story. You can read all about it in the new/revised Reviews section.

Plans for the future &#8230; Gwildor&#8217;s working on a Settlers of Catan-type web-based game, and I&#8217;ve been trying to help with it. He&#8217;s been working on the board, so today I started working on how the turns will work. We talked about it a little yesterday, so I&#8217;ll try to have something preliminary to show him tomorrow. And the NHL Conference Finals stats are ready to go on the left.
