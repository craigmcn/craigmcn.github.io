I can now understand some of the challenges in teaching. It&#8217;s really hard, until you present a &#8220;hands-on&#8221; exercise to get any kind of idea of whether students are learning. These guys don&#8217;t ask too many questions, don&#8217;t need too much clarification while I&#8217;m presenting the material, but when it comes to assessing their understanding, I find there&#8217;s a handful of things missing. I&#8217;m going to try to come up with some more involved, participatory exercises, so maybe I&#8217;ll get it all drilled into them.
