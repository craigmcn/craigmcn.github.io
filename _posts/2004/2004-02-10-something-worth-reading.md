I&#8217;d really like you to take a moment to read my [Editorial](/about-death-dying.html) for Feb 9/04. I spent a lot of time on it and I think it&#8217;s worth reading.

I spent another 2 hours on the phone with my sister last night. I thought we did pretty good keeping down to only 2 hours. Usually it gets to 3 or 4 hours by the time we actually hang up. You know those conversations that are always: &#8220;Man, okay, I gotta get going.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, me too, I&#8217;ve really gotta get to bed. I&#8217;ve been getting to bed too late the last little while &#8230;&#8221; &#8220;That reminds me &#8230;&#8221;Â And then the conversation goes another hour. Oh well, we enjoy our conversations.

Crappy. I have to go to the Oral Surgeon tomorrow. I&#8217;ve got 1 last wisdom tooth to come out. This one is under the gum to a certain extent and my dentist said he wouldn&#8217;t do it. I traded shifts with gwildor, so I could come in a little later, but also so he could go see [50 First Dates](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/50firstdates/); trikie got passes, again.
