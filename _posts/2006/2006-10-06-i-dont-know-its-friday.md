I realize now that my [Helpful hints](/helpful-hints.html) have actually hindered me. I can&#8217;t whinge so much anymore about the idiotic things people do. Well, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find something.

I thought I might get tired of looking at my site all pink like this, but I don&#8217;t actually end up on my site all that often. I mostly use an Admin area that uses a totally different [stylesheet](http://www.w3.org/Style/). But since you guys might get tired of it, maybe I&#8217;ll add a cookie option to let you turn off the special stylesheet. And it might be helpful, since I&#8217;m thinking of creating more themed stylesheets: Christmas, Easter, Spring/Summer, I don&#8217;t know, some other ones too. If anyone has any colour-scheme ideas, let me know.
