One quick tip for everybody: if you&#8217;re in line, make sure you look like you&#8217;re in line. I was down to [Alternative Grounds](http://www.alternativegrounds.com/) after a quick stop at [Pollock&#8217;s](http://www.homehardware.ca/en/dealer-microsites/1437-6/contact-information.htm) hardware store and I ended taking some dude&#8217;s coffee. He looked like he was in line for the cashier, but not quite, so I asked, &#8220;Are you in line?&#8221; &#8220;No, I&#8217;m waiting.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t happen to mention just what it was he was waiting for. I placed my order, then I sidled over to the counter where the [barista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barista) serves the coffee and waited for my single, non-fat latte. &#8220;Are you waiting for a single latte?&#8221; the lovely barista asked. &#8220;Indeed I am,&#8221; I responded. She handed me my coffee and thanked me for my business. (okay, maybe not quite, but something similarly welcoming.) As I took my first delicious sip of the life-giving beverage, I overheard the poor sap who was &#8220;waiting&#8221; say something about how he was waiting for his single, non-fat latte. Okay, schmuck, could you have made it any less obvious what you were doing? He was just standing around. Not ordering and not in the &#8220;pick-up&#8221; area. I would say that we shouldn&#8217;t need signs all over the place telling us what to do, but obviously that&#8217;s the only way people really know.
