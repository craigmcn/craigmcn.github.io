Woo hoo! Kaumauna&#8217;wana lei&#8217;a! I just got home from a &#8220;third wheel&#8221; party and, man, you missed a wicked good party. There&#8217;s was a [Mai Tai](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bartending/Cocktails/Mai_Tai) fountain, [lei&#8217;s](http://www.hawaiiflowerlei.com/), [hula hoops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula_hoop) and everything! The third wheel portion was that only couples were invited, but they were to bring an unattached [single] person. So that&#8217;s why I got to go. VeeDub and Red were the invitees, but Red was working. So VeeDub and I went and had several drinks, [some pizza](http://www.ninos.ca/), some pineapple and a whole lotta fun. Our hostess is a triathlete and is super ripped, but in a weird, emaciated way. I&#8217;m not sure what to think. The funniest part of the night was a video shot that should have gone on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/): VeeDub&#8217;s friend Little T tried to hula hoop while [shotgunning a beer](http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1313534) &#8230; debacle!
