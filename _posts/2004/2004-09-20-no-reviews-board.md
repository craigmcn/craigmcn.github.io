So I lied. Well, excuuuuuse me! Yeah, yeah, no <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318627/" target="_blank">Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> review on the &#8216;Reviews&#8217; board &#8230; in fact, no &#8216;Reviews&#8217; board. You see, I uploaded the &#8216;Puzzles&#8217;, but if you look, you&#8217;ll see that I had to change the quotes and some other special characters. I don&#8217;t know why, but the dBase manager doesn&#8217;t like quotes and stuff in the data. I&#8217;ll have to throw together a quick-and-dirty dBase manager to be able to upload the reviews properly. Sorry, I know you were all expecting an eloquent review of the latest zombie movie .. not right now.
