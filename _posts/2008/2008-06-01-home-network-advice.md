Okay, okay, I know I don&#8217;t post here too often anymore, and I&#8217;m going to try to rectify that, but I&#8217;m hoping someone might happen to read this post and provide the advice (and maybe some of the background) I need.

I want to set up a home network. I have a fairly decent, reliable network already, but I expect to have reason to expand it in the near future. I&#8217;m expecting at least 10 devices on the network: 3 general home PCs; 2 work-related laptops; 1 [NAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) device for backup/device-independent storage; 1 server for shared audio and video files; 1 network-attached [media player](http://www.dlink.com/products/?pid=318), connected to my home theatre system; and 2 printers. I would like them all to be wired, because I love the assured connectivity and higher speeds of a wired network. Preferably, the wired aspect would be through RJ45 jacks in pretty much every room (even better would be 1 RJ11 and 1 RJ45 jack in the same wall plate).

I&#8217;ll add another &#8220;nice-to-have&#8221;: 2 internet connections. I&#8217;m thinking that because [BitTorrent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_%28protocol%29) downloading sucks up ridiculous bandwidth, it would be nice to put the server on a separate internet connection, while still being connected to the rest of the network.

So, with all the routers, switches and print servers available, the question is: What&#8217;s best way to do what I want?
