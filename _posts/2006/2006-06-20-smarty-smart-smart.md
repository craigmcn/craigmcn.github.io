I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m wearing my smartypants today &#8230; I found this on <del>linkbunnies</del> and it blew my mind! [No, I&#8217;m Sorry, It Does.](http://polymathematics.typepad.com/polymath/2006/06/no_im_sorry_it_.html "No, I'm Sorry, It Does.")

Oh, and a quick response to wublub&#8217;s comment on the [last post](/what-up-dawg.html). I saw [The Aristocrats](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436078/) (I would link to a video clip, but it&#8217;s waay too nasty for my site.) and was a little disappointed by [Bob Saget](http://www.bobsaget.com/). I was expecting significantly dirtier material. It was HI-larious, but [Gilbert Gottfried](http://www.gilbertgottfried.com/) at the [Friar&#8217;s Club](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Friars%27_Club) was easily the best.
