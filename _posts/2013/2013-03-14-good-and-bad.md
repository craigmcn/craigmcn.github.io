I feel good and bad about myself for something I did the other day. As a rule, I don&#8217;t give money to panhandlers, nor do I give money to anyone out on the street. But I heard a very excellent version of Blue Rodeo&#8217;s [Western Skies](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/lost-together/) from a young man outside the mall and couldn&#8217;t help myself. I was even in a hurry and was walking away while he continued to play.
  
So, I feel good that I helped someone who was doing something he enjoyed, and who did something I enjoyed, but I feel bad that I violated my own rules. Oh well, I&#8217;ll get over it.
