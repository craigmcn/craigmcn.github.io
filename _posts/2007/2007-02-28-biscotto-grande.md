The title is a terrible translation of Big Cracker into Italian. Somehow the Google translator gave me _Cracker grande_, so I used biscuit and got _biscotto_. It&#8217;s probably a swear in Italian!

Anywho, the reason I&#8217;m feeling a little Italian, other than the macaroni I had for lunch, is that I spent my lunchtime with Cyon, Tall Guy and Jimmy learning to play [Scopa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa). They played a three-person game and Jimmy was throwin&#8217; down the Scopas left, right and centre. When I joined in for a four-person game, there was not a Scopa to be found. But I think we tied.
