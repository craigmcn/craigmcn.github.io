So I think a very attractive woman was sort of flirting with me on the subway on my way home from work. It was just idle chit-chat, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that there was absolutely no reason for her to talk to me at all. The reason it took me so long to figure it out, is &#8217;cause I&#8217;ve had someone flirt with me maybe four times in my life, and never a complete stranger and never on the subway.

I was reading the second-last chapter of [Harry Potter 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows) and she asked me if it was any good. Yes, I told her, it was my second time reading the book. And, in fact, I&#8217;d pretty much re-read the other six prior to getting the new one. She told me how she&#8217;s stuck at about the first 100 pages of [Harry Potter 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix); how she doesn&#8217;t want to cheat and see [the movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix_%28film%29), since it probably wrecks the story; how she just got into [Sudokus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) recently and the one she was working on had stumped her (I felt compelled to point out a mistake she&#8217;d made); and how she was living in [Vietnam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viet_Nam) for the last seven months with a boyfriend who was an ass and how she&#8217;s left him and moved back to T.O. and got a new job in North York that&#8217;s too far away from her new apartment in [The Beach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beaches#.22The_Beach.22_or_.22The_Beaches.22). Plus, she had a wicked tattoo wrapped around her upper arm: a large flower centred on the outside of her bicep with a vine and smaller flowers stretching around.

Anyway, a missed opportunity for the Big Cracker!
