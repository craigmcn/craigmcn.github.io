This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dreams_(Are_Made_of_This)) by
[Eurythmics](http://eurythmics.com/) from their 1983 album,
[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Dreams_(Are_Made_of_This)_(album)). The [Marilyn Manson](http://marilynmanson.com/)
version is from their 1995 album, [Smells Like Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smells_Like_Children).

The child in my household has some kind of game or show, or I don’t know what, that features this Marilyn Manson opening. I’m a little surprised I hadn’t posted this before.
