I meant to write this Friday, after it happened, but I just went home and watched TV. I got on the streetcar at the back door, since we were in the station. A woman got on at the front of the streetcar. The streetcar was obviously going to be full, judging from the number on the platfrom. I walked forward towards an empty seat and the woman walked towards the same seat. Instead of sitting down, she just stopped beside the seat, so I sat down in the seat. &#8220;Umm, I was holding that.&#8221; My response was simply to look at her, confused. &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221; It sure is fine, darlin&#8217;. This isn&#8217;t kindergarten, there are no &#8220;saves&#8221;. If you want the seat, sit in it, if you don&#8217;t, someone else will. In this case, me.
