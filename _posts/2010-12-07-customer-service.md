I read [an article about customer service](http://workawesome.com/general/keys-to-good-customer-service/) late last week and have some comments. My past colleagues may not entirely agree, but this is my opinion. (The picture is what I looked like when providing technical support over the phone.)

The author suggests that there are five key points to good customer service:

  * _Be prepared._ Absolutely. But being prepared and somehow magically knowing what the next customer’s request is going to be are two very different things. Whether I’m going to be making a double tall half-sweet raspberry mocha frappucino affogato or walking a customer through the process for removing malware from his computer, I can be prepared to do either of those things, but until I know which one I’m doing, I can’t already be doing it.
  * _Value people&#8217;s time._ Again, absolutely. But sometimes it takes time. Just as I can&#8217;t already be making the double tall half-sweet raspberry mocha frappucino affogato, it can&#8217;t instantly be ready.
  * _Don’t take it out on customers if you don’t like your job._ Okay. But sometimes shit happens. The barista doesn’t get to tell the customer to shut her pie hole when she’s being a bitch. So if the expectation is that the customer service representative can’t give attitude, maybe the customer should tone down hers.
  * _Never promise more than you can deliver._ Ahh, one of my favourites. Unfortunately, the person doing the promising is selling the product, not supporting it, and is often well out of the picture before a problem arises. The support representative gets to be on the other end doing his best to resolve the problem. Also, it’s not always the seller or the supporter who&#8217;ve made the empty promises, but sometimes customers’ unfounded and unrealistic expectations based on misinterpretation or misunderstanding.
  * _Be pleasant._ Sure, that goes without saying, but also follows from number three. Sometimes shit happens, and pleasant can be subjective. If the service is always slow or a particular employee always surly, maybe it should be brought to the attention of a manager. But if the customer got his order completely and correctly, and wasn&#8217;t directly insulted, maybe call it a win today and move on; someday the situation may be reversed.

[Another blog](http://www.sitepoint.com/customer-service-client-perspective/) highlighted some similar concepts and I’m glad they got the service they needed. But that level of service definitely comes at a cost that companies are rarely willing to pay.
