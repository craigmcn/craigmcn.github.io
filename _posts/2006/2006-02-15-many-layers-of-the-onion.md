So once a week I spend some time reading through the latest headlines in [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/), the finest repository of fake news on [the Internet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). (Of course, the finest fake news on television is [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart](http://www.thedailyshow.com/).) I really suggest you take a look &#8230; it&#8217;s HI-larious!!
