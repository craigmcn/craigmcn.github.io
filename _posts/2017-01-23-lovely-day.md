This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Lovely Day_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovely_Day_(song)) by [Bill Withers](http://billwithers.com/) from their 1977 album, [Menagerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menagerie_(album)). The [DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince](http://www.willsmith.com/) version is from their 1998 album, [Greatest Hits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Hits_(DJ_Jazzy_Jeff_%26_the_Fresh_Prince_album)).

I had part of this song in my head the other day. I don't know why, but I always thought this was a [Jamiroquai](http://www.jamiroquai.com/) song. When I looked it up, I couldn't even find a reference that Jamiroquai sampled the song. So here's the French Prince.
