I promised a [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/) tune, but the one I was thinking of [I already posted last year](http://craigmcn.ca/music-monday-one-more-night.html "Music Monday: One More Night")! So, instead, this week&#8217;s installment of Music Monday is [Patti Smith](http://www.pattismith.net/)&#8216;s _[Because the Night](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_the_Night)_, from the Patti Smith Group&#8217;s 1978 album, [Easter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_(Patti_Smith_Group_album)). The [Bruce Springsteen](http://brucespringsteen.net/) cover appears to be from the same era. Springsteen wrote the song for his 1978 album, [Darkness on the Edge of Town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_on_the_Edge_of_Town), but the song wasn&#8217;t included on the album. However, Springsteen performed the song with his lyrics on the tour for the album. You can probably start the video at about 2:30, if you want to hear the song and not just the long opening guitar solo. I actually thought it was a [10,000 Maniacs](http://www.maniacs.com/) tune, until I found the Springsteen cover, and found out that he co-wrote the song.
