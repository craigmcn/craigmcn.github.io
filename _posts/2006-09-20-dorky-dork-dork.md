I&#8217;m not sure whether I should be admitting my dorkiness to everyone, but since at least half of you are at least as dorky as I am, I should be okay. I was over to [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s place last night for some [Dungeons & Dragons](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome). Good times! Although my character lost his foot, and I was debating whether to bother retrieving it to continue the adventure. My fellow adventurer, White Worm, convinced me that he could heal the wound and we&#8217;d track down a wizard who could reattach the foot. I didn&#8217;t even get to swing my mace, because I was rolling on the ground in pain from the wound inflicted by a [Grimlock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimlock_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29). Although, I did get some extra [experience points](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/glossary&term=Glossary_dnd_experiencepoints&alpha=E) for singing a heroic, warrior [ballad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad) after our first battle was highly successful, capturing the elite warrior, Black Jaguar.
