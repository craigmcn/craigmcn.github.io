Woo hoo!! I finished [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero) on Hard last night! _[No One Knows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_One_Knows)_ gave me a ton of trouble and so did _[Frankenstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein_%28song%29)_, but I whipped through _[Cowboys from Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboys_from_Hell_%28song%29)_ and _[Bark at the Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_at_the_Moon_%28song%29)_ with ease.

Now to finish [Guitar Hero 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_II) on Hard. I&#8217;m stuck on _[Carry Me Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_in_Guitar_Hero_II#Main_setlist)_ and although I&#8217;ve done _[Laid to Rest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_in_Guitar_Hero_II#Main_setlist)_, I don&#8217;t even want to consider _[Psychobilly Freakout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yEjyuw42YY)_.
