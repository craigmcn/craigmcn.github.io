This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Black Day in July_](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/lightfoot-detroit-riots-sculpture-1.3672493) by [Gordon Lightfoot](http://www.lightfoot.ca/) from his 1968 album, [Did She Mention My Name?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Did_She_Mention_My_Name%3F). [The Tragically Hip](http://thehip.com/) version is from a 2003 tribute album, [Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful:_A_Tribute_to_Gordon_Lightfoot).

While looking for Tragically Hip covers to share, I thought it would be cool to share something they covered.
