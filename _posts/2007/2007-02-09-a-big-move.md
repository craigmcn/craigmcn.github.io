So, we had a big announcement at work yesterday, we&#8217;re moving. At the time, it didn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but the more I think about it, the worse it gets. It means an extra 15-20 minute commute for me (each way). It&#8217;s not a big thing, but an extra 40 minutes out of my day might wear thin after a while. My concern is for all the people who drive who&#8217;ll now be paying a minimum $100 extra _each month_. I don&#8217;t know too many people sitting on an extra c-note every month just waiting to drop it on parking. Plus, the commute is at least another 30 minutes for most drivers; more depending on where they&#8217;re coming from. My colleague will likely be on the road another 45 minutes, because she has to come through town to drop her kids at school.

I asked what support was being offered to employees who would be unable to make the move. Answer: none. Too bad, so sad. The excuse was made that the new location is at a major transit hub ([TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/), [GO](http://www.gotransit.com/), [VIVA](http://www.yorkregiontransit.com/)) and there is plenty of parking in the area. No mention was made that the location is not on a major freeway and that parking is 400-500% more expensive. They played up the fact that there are all kinds of new career opportunities available at the new location. Except the opportunities have always been available; had I wanted one, I would be there already. They downplayed any loss of jobs. Sure, for now. But they&#8217;re consolidating a varied 200-person department that will certainly develop some [economies of scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_scale) once they&#8217;re all in the same location.

It really upsets me that they&#8217;re playing this so casually. &#8220;We&#8217;re just picking up and moving. It&#8217;s no big deal. Nothing else will change, just the location.&#8221; They seem to have completely disregarded the impact on the employees, which says to me that they don&#8217;t care. &#8220;Can&#8217;t come with? See ya!&#8221; It&#8217;s not like, for example, Saskatoon, where a move of this distance means a move across town, and means a commute of an extra 10-15 minutes (or less). Plus, many people drive across town everyday anyway. When the difference is 30-45 minutes, on top of an 1.5 hour commute, the difference is enormous. And parking in Saskatoon is entirely reasonable, not $125 a month. And traffic is generally pretty decent. Hmmm, maybe it&#8217;s time to go back.
