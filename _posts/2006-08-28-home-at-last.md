Oh. My. God! I&#8217;m finally home! My flight was cancelled (thankfully I knew about it before even leaving for the airport). I got the next flight, but it didn&#8217;t leave until 1:45am. The plane landed in T-dot just before 7am and I had my luggage before 7:30am. I caught the bus, then the subway and got home just after 8am. (I often commute with Shuttergirl and she happened to be getting off the bus just as I was getting on at the station. Funny.) The flight was fairly uneventful, but I had a helluva time trying to sleep.

The original flight was cancelled because there wasn&#8217;t a crew for the plane. The flight is supposed to go from T.O. to S&#8217;toon and back, but due to problems in T.O. and some silly Transport Canada rules, the crew that came in had already flown too long and couldn&#8217;t fly back. So my flight had no crew, yay!

Kind of a shitty end to a wicked good vacation.
