I sometimes wonder if subconsciously I agree with Garcin, the leading male character in [Jean-Paul Sartre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre)&#8216;s [1944](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_in_literature) play [No Exit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit), in his response to Inès, “Hell is other people!”

While the afternoon and evening of Cyon&#8217;s wedding were very nice, with good friends, good food and good times, I had a headache the whole time, making the whole time mostly uncomfortable. I get headaches periodically and, obviously, I&#8217;ve survived them all. But often enough, they come during extended periods of close interaction with many people, or with people with whom I have little in common.

So I wonder whether it&#8217;s my body&#8217;s reaction to a lot of people, making my life hellish. Hmmm &#8230;.
