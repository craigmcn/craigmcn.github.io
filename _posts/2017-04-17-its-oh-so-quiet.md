This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_It’s Oh So Quiet_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Oh_So_Quiet) by [Betty Hutton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Hutton) from the B-side to her 1951 single, _Murder, He Says_. The [Björk](http://bjork.com/) version is from her 1995 album, [Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_(Bj%C3%B6rk_album)).

I won’t get into Horst Winter’s 1948 German original, nor Ginette Garcin’s 1949 French version. Björk doesn’t cover any new ground here, but _Post_ is one of my favourite albums, and now I know this is a cover.
