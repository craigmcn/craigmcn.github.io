Wednesday, good old Wednesday. It&#8217;s morning, I&#8217;ve got a coffee, it&#8217;s all good. I&#8217;m listening to my good buddy DJ Gwildor on the Freak Radio. Good Times!

You may have noticed my cute, little &#8216;Loading &#8230;&#8217; message at the top of the page when you opened it up. That&#8217;s my latest contribution. I discovered it while working on a page that will allow me to access my email from this website. It was taking so long for the page to load (longer than this page even) that I wanted some note to show what was going on. So I implemented it on all my pages.

The email is kinda cool, except I&#8217;ve spent easily 12 or more hours on it and all it does is display From, Subject, Date and a paper-clip icon if the message has attachments. You (I) can&#8217;t actually read the message yet, but I know how to make that happen. I&#8217;m still trying to figure out just what sort of structure to have &#8230; a folder for each address, then a file for each email, or a database with all the stuff? I don&#8217;t know. Once it&#8217;s done, I&#8217;ll attach it to the login stuff, once _that_&#8216;s done. That way everyone can check their email, if they want.
