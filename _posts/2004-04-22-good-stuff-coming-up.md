Wow, 2 in 2 days! I&#8217;ve definitely never been a prolific writer, but I&#8217;ve got some stuff to add to yesterday&#8217;s blog. First, I&#8217;ll respond to [my sister&#8217;s response to yesterday&#8217;s post](/good-without-the-tooth.html), then I&#8217;ll let you in on some good stuff that&#8217;s coming up.

So my sister asked, “What the hell does ‘blog’ mean anyway? Is it a kind of onomatopeic word describing the disgorgement of the brain onto the internet?” And her guess is not far from the truth&#8230;.

‘Blog’ is short for Weblog. Stolen straight from <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank">blogger.com</a>:

> A blog is a web page made up of usually short, frequently updated posts that are arranged chronologically — like a what&#8217;s new page or a journal. The content and purposes of blogs varies greatly — from links and commentary about other web sites, to news about a company/person/idea, to diaries, photos, poetry, mini-essays, project updates, even fiction.
> 
> Blog posts are like instant messages to the web.
  
> Many blogs are personal, &#8220;what&#8217;s on my mind&#8221; type musings. Others are collaborative efforts based on a specific topic or area of mutual interest. Some blogs are for play. Some are for work. Some are both.
> 
> Blogs are also excellent team/department/company/family communication tools. They help small groups communicate in a way that is simpler and easier to follow than email or discussion forums. Use a private blog on an intranet to allow team members to post related links, files, quotes, or commentary. Set up a family blog where relatives can share personal news. A blog can help keep everyone in the loop, promote cohesiveness and group culture, and provide an informal &#8220;voice&#8221; of a project or department to outsiders.

So there&#8217;s a quick and dirty lesson on blogs. Of course my links to gwildor, wublub and <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/paulwells" target="_blank">Inkless Wells</a> are good examples of blogs as well.

The 2<sup>nd</sup> thing I want to mention is <a href="http://rraz.ca/Jazz.html" target="_blank">the Distillery Jazz Festival</a>, here in The Big Smoke! I&#8217;ll admit, I knew nothing about this festival until today, but my good buddy h! is for Hulk sent me an email today to let me know about it.

Direct from the horse&#8217;s (Hulk&#8217;s?) mouth:

> T and I have been tapped by the festival to put a show together which involves 4 new videos set to live music (also new) performed by the Love Orchestra. This is the first new work I&#8217;ve shown in close to two years, I think, so those of you who haven&#8217;t had a chance to publicly ridicule me lately should definitely come out. Rotten tomatoes will be provided at the door. (note: the band is not to be harmed)
  
> **<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">SAME DAY, SAME FESTIVAL, DIFFERENT LOCATION, DIFFERENT TIME!</span>** Prior to the video screening, The Love Orchestra will be doing a performance with Ming Hon, a crazy little modern dancer with a formidable knowledge of all things Stevie Wonder. I have no idea what this gig will be like but Ming-a-ling promises laughs, and possibly, giant masks. Woo-ha!

Depending on the time of day, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll make it. But if h! is for Hulk is involved, I suggest you try to get to it yourselves&#8230; Hey, how many people even read this thing? h! is for Hulk says May 26, but keep an eye on the <a href="http://rraz.ca/Jazz.html" target="_blank">Distillery Jazz Festival</a> website for more updates. I&#8217;ll try to keep up-to-date myself.

Well, that&#8217;s it for now &#8230; consider this my first foray into making “Jazz in Toronto” info available on the site.
