Ha ha, joke&#8217;s on me! So, I saved the [Substitute (Day 2)](http://craigmcn.ca/substitute-day-2.html "Substitute (Day 2)") blog post, because I hadn&#8217;t quite finished it, but it still showed up in the [RSS feed](/feed/rss/). It completely slipped my mind that the RSS feed doesn&#8217;t know to exclude saved posts. Although, thanks for the response [Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/). Yeah, my head sorta hurts too!
