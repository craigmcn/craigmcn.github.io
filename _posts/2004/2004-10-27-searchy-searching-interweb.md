Just a quick note for anybody who has the same problem I did &#8230; I&#8217;m using Mozilla 1.7.2 as my default web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird 0.7.3 as my default mail application &#8230; cool, no Microsoft! But whenever I clicked on &#8216;mailto&#8217; links in web pages, Mozilla Mail (the built-in mail app for the browser) not Thunderbird would open. I didn&#8217;t really want to install Firefox, just to get a stand-alone browser (eventually, but not right now). So I searchy-searched on the interweb and came up with <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum119/399.htm" target="_blank">one whole hit</a> that solved my problem. <del>(The link may not work, it didn&#8217;t for me when I linked directly, so <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=Using+Firefox+but+Netscape+opens+on+mailto%3A+link&btnG=Search&meta=" target="_blank">try this one</a>, it should be the first hit.)</del> The solution it gives — to access and edit the &#8216;about:config&#8217; page — is ingenious, but not published anywhere in the literature that I could find. I would have thought that it was a common problem with people in my situation, but I guess not.
