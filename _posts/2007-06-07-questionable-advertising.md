This sort of follows from my [previous post](/i-dont-know-what-to-say.html) about violence. And maybe this is a better topic of study for [ad-titude.com](http://www.ad-titude.com/), but I&#8217;m going with it.

[The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB)](http://www.wsib.on.ca/wsib/wsibsite.nsf/public/home_e) has a public awareness campaign on right now hosted at a website called [prevent-it.ca](http://www.prevent-it.ca/). I see the ads on the subway all the time and I think they&#8217;re highly questionable. They certainly give the impression that we (and especially the targeted youth audience) have become inured to images of violence.

I would like to believe that images of violence are still shocking and undesirable, but it seems that &#8220;the media&#8221; doesn&#8217;t think so.

**Update** (_June 15_): Sorry, maybe I should have been more descriptive about the advertising. The 3 posters I&#8217;ve seen on the subway are:

  1. a guy missing a thumb, wearing a bloody bandage on his hand, trying to play [Xbox](http://www.xbox.com/),
  2. a guy with a steel pole through his ears trying to talk on a cell phone, and
  3. a bloody ear on the ground with an earbud in it.

The point being that by being unsafe at work (e.g, losing a thumb, getting a steel pole through your head, losing an ear) makes it difficult to enjoy yourself. It just seems to me that the images are rather more graphic than necessary.
