> As a CIA officer, Evelyn Salt swore an oath to duty, honor and country. Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. Salt goes on the run, using all her skills and years of experience as a covert operative to elude capture. Salt&#8217;s efforts to prove her innocence only serve to cast doubt on her motives, as the hunt to uncover the truth behind her identity continues and the question remains: “Who is Salt?”

Obviously, I went to see [Salt](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944835/) this weekend. Obvious only because of the title of this post and the included plot synopsis. And what a good movie. Some good chases and escapes, things blowing up, people jumping from high-rise windows and moving vehicles.

But the best parts were definitely the plot twists that serve to provide and convolute the answer given above: “Who is Salt?” Maybe she&#8217;s innocent and unfairly targeted as a Russian agent, or maybe she&#8217;s a Russian agent so far undercover for so long she&#8217;s forgotten, or maybe protesting her innocence is how she completes her deep cover mission. Or maybe &#8230;.

But you&#8217;ll have to check it out for yourselves. **8 out of 10** saltines.
