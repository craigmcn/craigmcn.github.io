This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Violent Kin](http://violentkin.com/)&#8216;s _Keep Your Balance_ from their 2010 EP [Velvet Hideout](http://violentkin.com/music.html). I&#8217;ve been cleaning off a bookshelf in my workshop in order to &#8220;minimalize&#8221; the space; I&#8217;m going to replace the bookshelf with a table. This has involved finding a new home for about 150 compact discs. The first step has been ripping the CDs to my computer, and also cleaning up the existing music files on my computer. While cleaning up the Violent Kin folder, I remembered that the photography for this video was done by my good friend [Maki](http://www.makifotos.com/index.php?splash=1#/maki), and I thought I would share it with you.
