I&#8217;ll just bet you saw the title of this post and thought you in for another enlightening political discussion from Big Cracker. Nope! I spent the other night at [Folkfest](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/home), here in sunny Saskatoon; &#8220;One World One Race&#8221; is this year&#8217;s slogan.

Back when I was a lad, I played bagpipes in a couple of pipe bands: [the 96th Highlanders](http://www.96th.ca/) and the [I&#8217;ll just bet you saw the title of this post and thought you in for another enlightening political discussion from Big Cracker. Nope! I spent the other night at [Folkfest](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/home), here in sunny Saskatoon; &#8220;One World One Race&#8221; is this year&#8217;s slogan.

Back when I was a lad, I played bagpipes in a couple of pipe bands: [the 96th Highlanders](http://www.96th.ca/) and the](http://www.saskpipebands.org/html/bands/nsr.html) (there&#8217;s an &#8220;[official site](http://nsrpd.tripod.com/)&#8220;, but it looks equally terrible). There&#8217;s a [Scottish Pavilion](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/scottish.php) at Folkfest where we&#8217;d hang out for 3 days straight (pretty much to the exclusion of all of our other friends). And we&#8217;d play 4 or 5 times a night, I guess. Prob&#8217;ly about once every hour or so, and it was tiring, but kinda fun. So, that&#8217;s where I was, checking out the old bands, who sounded really good. And drinking some [delicious beer](http://www.ratebeer.com/Ratings/Beer/Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=879).

VeeDub, Reb and the kids and Jock &#8216;n&#8217; Doc were out to the Scottish Pavilion, because Little P was [Highland Dancing](http://www.shda.ca/shdaweb.htm). She did some fine work.

I also managed to stop by the [Karpaty Ukrainian](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/ukrainiankarpaty.php), [Afro-Caribbean](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/caribbean.php) and [Philippines](http://www.saskatoonfolkfest.ca/philippines.php) pavilions. Good food, good dancing and good martial arts demos, respectively.
