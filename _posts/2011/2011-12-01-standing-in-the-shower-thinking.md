<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8133385/images/rsz_sunrise.jpg" alt="Sunrise" width="300" height="225" align="left" />I just read a short [37Signals post](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3048-morning-tells-the-truth) about how “[t]<span>he next morning has a way of telling the you truth.” It’s a good, quick post that doesn’t continue <em>ad nauseum</em> and undo the good advice with a bunch of nonsense.</span>

<span>The first comment caught my eye (“I’d also add: Take a shower.”) and reminded me about how much I like contemplating things in the shower. I’ve come up with a lot of good ideas and real solutions by letting the idea percolate while the hot water wakes me up and starts my day.</span>

Unfortunately, sometimes I realize that I’m standing in the shower thinking, and then all I can think about is the [Jane’s Addiction song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing%27s_Shocking#Track_listing "Nothing's Shocking - Standing in the Shower... Thinking").
