This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Both Sides, Now_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Both_Sides,_Now) by [Joni Mitchell](http://jonimitchell.com/) from her 1969 album, [Clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouds_(Joni_Mitchell_album)). The [Melanie C](http://www.melaniec.net/) version is from her 2012 album, [Stages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stages_(Melanie_C_album)).

I don’t even like this song. We sang the fun out of it in grade five or six music. But when I was thinking of a Music Monday entry, I looked out the window and saw the &#8220;ice cream castles in the air&#8221;. I’m glad I found out that Mel C did a cover.
