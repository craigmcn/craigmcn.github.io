So, yesterday was <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/jfa-ha/canada-eng.cfm">Canada Day</a> &#8230; I hope everyone had a great day off, enjoyed the fabulous weather here in T.O. and hopefully it was equally spectacular everywhere else!! I was down to the [Harbourfront](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/) for [Feist](http://www.listentofeist.com/SITE/) and [Spookey Ruben](http://www.hi-hat.ca/spookey/), and the [crappy] fireworks. In the crowd were [Daryn Jones](https://www.google.ca/search?q=daryn+jones&sugexp=chrome,mod=14&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and [I&#8217;m pretty sure] this girl I&#8217;ve seen in a lot of commercials (I couldn&#8217;t find a link for her).

Today is [Live 8](http://www.live8live.com/) day!! Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m supposed to tell you guys about making poverty history:

&#8220;Today, I became part of an unprecedented global call to action to end poverty: [Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/)

Right now, there is active campaigning in over 50 countries around the three core demands: More and Better Aid, Make Trade Fair, and Cancel the Debt. In Canada, we&#8217;re also campaigning to End Child Poverty in Canada.

You&#8217;ve just got to be a part of this campaign.

Go to [http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/) and sign on to the campaign yourself.

There is no time to lose. It doesn&#8217;t matter who or where you are, your voice is **critical** to the success of this campaign. This is a rare chance to join me and thousands of others across the planet to once and for all make poverty history.

What are you waiting for? [Join me and click in!](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/)&#8221;

I also advocate the [very old idea of] [revaluation of IMF gold reserves](http://www.taxfreegold.co.uk/gordonbrownimfgoldrevaluationg7goldsales.html) to reduce Third World debt.

I know you guys are vaguely politcally aware &#8230; Get on board!! Plus, I&#8217;m ordering up some white bands, posters and stickers &#8230; First come, first served &#8230; Let me know what you want.
