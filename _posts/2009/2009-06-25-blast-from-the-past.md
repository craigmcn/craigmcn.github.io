My [Google Alert](http://www.google.com/alerts) for bigcracker.ca fired me an email today letting me know about a reference to bigcracker.ca somewhere in the depths of the interwebs. Apparently, the little web searching gnomes take their sweet time, because [the reference in question](http://cherubi.livejournal.com/132051.html) is from 2006!

The reference within the post is to [a super old post](/crackers-on-a-plane.html "Crackers on a Plane") about the mocking I got on a flight from [T-Dot](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=T%20Dot) to [S&#8217;toon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/) (check out [this definition!](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stoon)). I&#8217;m a little impressed that this youngster remembered enough about my website to check it out, and then comment on it. Although, I sort of wish I&#8217;d seen her post earlier.

Anyway, kind of funny what the internet turns up sometimes. Here&#8217;s some other stuff:

  * Would you like to buy a monkey? (<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbCc2jeEQdY>)
  * Fancy Lad (<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X8istCTeQE>; related to the above)
  * Letterman as Ellsworth on [Mork & Mindy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077053/) ([Mork Goes Erk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0651213/); <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny6p9_zlOJc>)
  * C for Cat (<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3tgrEvpPck>)
  * Capital I (<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=losBZCpzbi8>)
