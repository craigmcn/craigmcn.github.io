I’ve been watching [Death in Paradise](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1888075/) on [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/) lately. It’s a pretty solid detective show set in the Caribbean. The lead detective had a bit of puzzle on his mind in one episode, and I’m going to share with you.

A man is heading home after acquiring a fox, a goose and a bag of beans. On his way, he must cross a river, but his boat will only carry himself and one of his acquisitions at a time.

Knowing that if he leaves the fox and goose alone together, the fox will eat the goose. And if he leaves the goose alone with the bag of beans, the goose will eat the beans.

How does the man get all of his acquisitions to the other side of the river?
