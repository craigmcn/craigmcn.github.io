excerpt: "I don’t need to engage with someone who’s not engaged with me. Once the topic has moved away from whatever involved me, especially if I still had something to contribute, I'll probably just shut down for a time, until the conversation either comes back around or moves onto something for which I have a contribution."

I don’t need to engage with someone who’s not engaged with me. I&#8217;m not quite sure what prompted me to think about this, but it happens fairly regularly.

For example, a small group is having a conversation and while discussing one issue, the conversation moves into other topics. Once the topic has moved away from whatever involved me, especially if I still had something to contribute, I&#8217;ll probably just shut down for a time, until the conversation either comes back around or moves onto something for which I have a contribution.

Another case is when someone talks about something as a general truth, but with which I disagree. &#8220;&#8230; so, _of course_, I had to tell her that was the wrong action to take &#8230;&#8221; Nope, it sounds like the right action, but you&#8217;re convinced and I don&#8217;t really want to get into it, so I&#8217;m just going to disengage and leave it alone.

I will listen and learn, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but I almost definitely won&#8217;t contribute. Perhaps this has something to do with [introverts and extroverts](/for-the-extroverts-out-there.html), but probably it&#8217;s just me.
