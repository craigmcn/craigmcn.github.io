I love things that are great, good things are fantastic
  
Guess what, I also paint, just a hobby, nothing drastic

&#8216;Cause I dig everything, except the things I don&#8217;t
  
And I&#8217;ll try anything, except the things I say I won&#8217;t

But one thing&#8217;s for sure
  
I love things &#8230; scoo-dooby doo be bop
  
That are great! Yeah!
