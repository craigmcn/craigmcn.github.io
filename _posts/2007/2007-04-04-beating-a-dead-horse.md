The software I support has some performance issues. Inconsistently, once or twice in the day, specific parts of the system get very slow for about 20-30 minutes. It has been happening now for about 6-8 weeks. For some reason every time it happens, people are surprised. Even my counterpart who&#8217;s usually pretty good with this kind of stuff told me about an incident late yesterday as though it was news. &#8220;But it&#8217;s happening with the Customer Search, too!&#8221; Yeah, _that_&#8216;s when it happens. It&#8217;s been ongoing for almost 60 days, I think by now we should be pretty clear on the problem and the solution &#8212; be patient, wait, try again later.

Users report the problem to us, we report the problem to the technology guys, they investigate. They&#8217;re pretty sure they know the problem, but they still need to solve it and implement the solution. It takes time. Be patient, wait, try again later.
