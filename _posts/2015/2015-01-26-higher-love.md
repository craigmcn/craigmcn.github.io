This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Higher Love_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Love) by [Steve Winwood](http://www.stevewinwood.com/) from his 1986 album, [Back in the High Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_in_the_High_Life). The [James Vincent McMorrow](http://www.jamesvmcmorrow.com/) version is from a 2011 charity album, [Silver Lining](http://entertainment.ie/music/news/JV-McMorrow-Heathers-on-Charity-Covers-Album/70422.htm). This was supposed to be last week&#8217;s post, I was reminded of it during yoga a few days ago&mdash;I&#8217;m not sure how I missed getting it published.
