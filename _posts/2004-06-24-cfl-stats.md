Alright!! I finally got the CFL stats working! Although it always kinda pisses me off when I can&#8217;t figure out why something isn&#8217;t working, so I just find a different way of doing it, rather than try to fix what&#8217;s not working. But, actually, the code is a little less complex now, so I guess that&#8217;s good.
