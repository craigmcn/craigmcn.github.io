I’m a few posts in here and I realize that I probably need to let you know what this is all about.

Tumblr is a company that provides a web application for blogging.

> Tumblr lets you effortlessly **share anything**. Post text, photos, quotes, links, music, and videos, from your browser, phone, desktop, email, or wherever you happen to be.

Cool.

What you see is just some posts. I’m trying to keep them short and to the point. But there’s a couple of other things, too.

At the bottom of each post should be a section for comments; I’m using Disqus to manage those, because Tumblr doesn’t.

On the left is a bunch of other things:

  * a picture of pretty me
  * a note about the tumblelog
  * a way to search, either my blog or Tumblr
  * my latest tweets; some from here, some through Twitter
  * who I’m following on Tumblr
  * different ways to get to my tumblelog

So that’s what’s here. If you need help, let me know.

P.S. I sort of like this boring default theme, but I may change it.
