My love for <a href="http://www.melissaaufdermaur.org" target="_blank">Melissa Auf der Maur</a> continues unabated. I managed to watch the episode of CBC&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Canadian" target="_blank">Greatest Canadian</a> that she hosted â€” extolling the virtues of Dr. David Suzuki, geneticist, humanitarian and environmentalist extraordinaire. I was really impressed. Firstly, because Suzuki is such a solid dude, but also because <a href="http://www.aufdermaur.com" target="_blank">Auf der Maur</a> is really intelligent and well-spoken. I wasn&#8217;t really surprised, but considering she used to hang with Courtney Love &#8230;
