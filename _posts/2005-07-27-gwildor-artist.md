Alright, because [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com) thinks he&#8217;s some kind of arteest and is going to create some kind of webcomic, I contributed to his Paypal donation fund for a [tablet](http://www.tigerdirect.ca/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1388849&CatId=0). Here&#8217;s a short list of the kinds of things he&#8217;s been thinking about &#8230; (he&#8217;s my buddy, I gotta support him, don&#8217;t I?) &#8230;

  * [White Ninja](http://www.whiteninjacomics.com)
  * [PvP Online](http://pvponline.com/comic)
  * [ctrl+alt+del](http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/)

I know these are already listed on his site, but they&#8217;re pretty good. (And I keep wanting to use bullet points in my blogs!)

I say good luck to the big guy!!
