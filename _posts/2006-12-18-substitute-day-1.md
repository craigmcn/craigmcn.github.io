One down, four more to go. I hammered through what is probably one of the biggest hitters in terms of _Horizon_ calls, the _SM@RT_ sales tracking application, in one day. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad. The class seemed to pick it up with no problem. They plowed through like experts the exercises I had them do. And I remembered all kinds of good things and helpful hints. All in all, I think we did alright.
