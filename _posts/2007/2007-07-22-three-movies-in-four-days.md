I&#8217;ll have reviews out for all three movies in a little bit (probably tomorrow afternoon), but that&#8217;s been my week this week. Thursday and Friday evenings and Sunday afternoon were all about the movies. [Harry Potter 5](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373889/), then [1408](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/), then [Live Free or Die Hard](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/). In between, I finished reading [Harry Potter 6](http://www.amazon.ca/Harry-Potter-Half-Blood-Prince-Book/dp/155192756X/ref=pd_sxp_grid_i_0_2/702-0565813-2365616), watched the last two episodes of [ReGenesis](http://www.tv.com/regenesis/show/29414/summary.html) season 3 and waited with bated breath for [Harry Potter 7](http://www.amazon.ca/Harry-Potter-Deathly-Hallows-Book/dp/1551929767/ref=sr_1_6/702-0565813-2365616?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1185153649&sr=8-6) to be delivered to my doorâ€”I&#8217;ve now finished it.

I&#8217;ve spent every waking moment (some of which I should have spent sleeping) reading _Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows_ and loving every minute of it! I can&#8217;t say much without giving a lot away, but I will say that it ended exactly the way I had hoped. For anyone who knows my theory, they may be disappointed. Again, without giving it all away, I had theories and I had hopes and the book, the story, the saga finished exactly the way it needed to.
