With the concert a month ago and this year being the 25th anniversary of the release of their classic album, [Outskirts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outskirts_(album)), I&#8217;ve had a lot of [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/) in my head. With this past long weekend, and a lot of sleeping in, I&#8217;ve had the opening of this particular song in my head. For your listening pleasure and my Music Monday contribution, here&#8217;s Blue Rodeo&#8217;s [_House of Dreams_](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/diamond-mine/), from their sophomore 1989 album, [Diamond Mine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Mine_(Blue_Rodeo_album)).
