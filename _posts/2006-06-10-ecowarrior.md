I feel so good about myself today. I rode <a title="Schwinn 5-star Cruiser" href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/928-4948-1-PB.jpg" rel="lightbox">my bike</a> to the grocery store. I brought some grocery bags from other grocery experiences and my [big courier bag](http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/retail/catalog.htm?categoryId=6&skusetId=129). I put the cold, sweaty stuff in the previously used grocery bags before loading them in the courier bag. I bungeed the laundry detergent to the rack on the back. And I rode home. No gas, exhaust or other unfriendly by-products of automobile usage. No extra plastic bags, etc. And the products I purchased had as little packaging as is available.

Yup, I feel pretty good about myself.
