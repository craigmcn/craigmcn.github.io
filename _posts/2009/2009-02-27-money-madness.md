Or method? I caught [this post on Zen Habits](http://zenhabits.net/2009/02/10-essential-money-skills-for-a-bad-economy/) and found it really informative. I don&#8217;t know how many things I&#8217;ll actually implement, but it&#8217;s so true: if you keep track of where your money is going, it&#8217;s easier to figure out where it doesn&#8217;t need to go. How many times have you found yourself with an empty wallet hours (or minutes) after stopping at the [ATM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine)? Probably a whole bunch, just like me.

I realize it&#8217;s pretty long, but give the article a read, I think there&#8217;s a couple of pointers for everyone.
