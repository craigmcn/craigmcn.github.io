[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) filed it under Clever Uses, but [cleaning stains out of your coffee mug with baking soda](http://lifehacker.com/5838321/clean-stains-out-of-your-coffee-mug-with-baking-soda) should be a standard use, not a clever one. Generally, I think most people are aware that baking soda gets rid of all kinds of stains, as well as odours. But, I suppose, for those who don’t, this might be helpful advice. Carry on.
