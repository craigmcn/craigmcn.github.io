Well, a big &#8220;Hey, Howdy!&#8221; to everyone late on a Monday night. Good news, Gwildor, Wublub and I are now live on ExternalGateway.com &#8230; well, I know Gwildor and I have moved our sites over &#8230; with a few wrinkles here and there, but &#8220;Live and Learn&#8221; I always say. Always? Well, maybe not _always_. But I think I&#8217;ve said it, like, once, at least.

For me, only the Home page and the part of the Admin page that let&#8217;s me blog are fully functional. If you noticed over the weekend, I had a &#8216;Maintenance&#8217; message up. I&#8217;ve decided that when I load this beast up, it will be doing exactly what I want, and only what I want. I&#8217;ve taken down the &#8216;local weather&#8217;. I&#8217;ll try to put it back up, but I found that it was noticeably slowing down the loading of the page. Hopefully, you will have noticed, too &#8230; No? Surprising.

We have our work cut out for us, getting ExternalGateway.com up and running properly. We have to set up a PayPal Merchant account to accept payment, we have to make sure that signing up and getting accounts set-up is simple and straightforward, we have to have plans in place for what we do, what we don&#8217;t do, what we know, what we don&#8217;t know &#8230; Good Times!
