So I&#8217;ve been contemplating writing a real blog. You know, the kind with daily (or multiple daily) posts and maybe accompanied by a weekly podcast. I think I&#8217;d have a lot of fun working on it, I just don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d write. That is, I don&#8217;t know what I could write about for any significant period of time and have anything intelligent to say every time. I think I&#8217;d like to stick with my current area of interest, web development, but where do I focus? I&#8217;d like to include [usability](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030825.html), [design](http://webdesign.about.com/), [valid markup](http://validator.w3.org/docs/why.html), [fonts](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html), [cross-browser compatibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser), [content management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system), [server-side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_scripting) versus [client-side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client-side_scripting) scripting, [spelling, grammar](http://www.askoxford.com/betterwriting/classicerrors/)&#8230;. See? Where do I focus? Is all that too much? Not enough? There&#8217;s [a jillion web design blogs](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=web+design+blog&btnG=Search&meta=) out there, why am I special? Do I need to get a couple of people to write as well, to build more content? Obviously, I have a tough enough time updating this monstrosity, am I prepared to go bigger?

Well, I&#8217;ll let it simmer for a while.
