According to [this Wired article](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/05/how-pixars-up-house-could-really-fly/) from a few days ago, the house in [Pixar&#8217;s new movie _Up_](http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/up/) might really be able to fly. Apparently, with enough balloons (upwards of 100,000; which the _Up_ house seems to have), you could plausibly generate enough lift to raise the house. I think that&#8217;s kinda cool.
