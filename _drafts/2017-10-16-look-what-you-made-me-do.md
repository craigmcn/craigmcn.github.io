This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Look What You Made Me Do_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do) by [Taylor Swift](http://taylorswift.com/) from her 2017 album, [Reputation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_(Taylor_Swift_album)). The [Our Last Night](http://www.ourlastnight.com/) version is from a 2017 recording. Apparently I'm on a Taylor Swift kick right now.
