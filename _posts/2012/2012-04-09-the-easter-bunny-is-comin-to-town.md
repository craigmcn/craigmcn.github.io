I only remember a few pieces, but I also have a cassette tape recording of me discussing the synopsis and mentioning one of the villains of the movie, Gadzooks, the mean grizzly bear.

Being Easter Sunday, I chose to watch the movie again last night after our big family dinner. What a mess! The movie is not very good. The religious references are poorly done and the story is generally just a random mix of silly stories that try to explain the origins of random Easter traditions (that may or may not exist).

It was challenging to watch; I wanted to turn it off numerous times. But like a traffic accident, I just couldn’t turn away. I suppose for a four-year-old in 1979, the story was vaguely entertaining and the stop-motion animation was compelling. But for a 21st-century man in his late 30s, it was junk. Sorry, some things just don’t stand the test of time.
