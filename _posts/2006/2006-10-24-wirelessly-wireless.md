Woo hoo! I got the [Range Extender](http://www.dlink.com/ca/en/home-solutions/connect/access-points-range-extenders-and-bridges) I&#8217;d [gone looking for Friday](/illegal-activity.html) (and Saturday, but I refrained from mentioning that part). I&#8217;m now highly wireless within my basement. I could have even blogged from my living room last night, but I was watching wirelessly streamed [downloaded]Â [Star Trek Voyager](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-voyager) instead. I still need to work out how to not broadcast the router (even though it&#8217;s 128-bit-WEP-secured). The couple of things I tried stopped the laptop and the range extender from connecting, so I&#8217;m not sure what I need to do. Oh well, I&#8217;ll figure it out.
