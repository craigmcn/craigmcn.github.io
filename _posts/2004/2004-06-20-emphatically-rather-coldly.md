Obviously, I&#8217;m not important enough to merit comments about my boycotting of the staff barbecue — thanks for _your_ input, K — fine! Anyway, as you can well imagine, I didn&#8217;t go. And nobody noticed. Well, I guess a couple of people noticed, and maybe more, but only 1 person actually said something&#8230; &#8220;Ha! You forgot about the barbecue?&#8221; (imagine this in a _Wayne&#8217;s World_-esque tone) &#8230; &#8220;No,&#8221; I responded, concisely, emphatically and rather coldly.

And again, obviously, this site is limited to my inconsistent, intermittent ramblings, which are vague, pointless and rarely read — a testament to my lack of importance, or perhaps simply a lack of interest in what little I have to say. Well, I&#8217;m going to try to be more consistent, posting a little more regularly and keeping you apprised of what is on in my life. So, when we speak, you may already know what I&#8217;ve been up to and we can discuss.

Boy, this is sounding overly depressive &#8230; a discussion of my inferiority complex. I&#8217;m pretty excited about my mommy coming at the end of the week. We won&#8217;t get too much time together, but anything I can get is cool by me. Living at opposite ends of the country is pretty tough.

Otherwise a pretty relaxed weekend. I picked up <a href="http://www.lizphair.com/" target="_blank">Liz Phair</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Liz-Phair/dp/B00009OOH9/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&ie=UTF8&qid=1345739413&sr=1-1" target="_blank">latest album</a>. I&#8217;d heard a handful of the tracks and I&#8217;m a huge fan, so I decided to pay _real_ money for it (unlike most of the albums I&#8217;ve _acquired_ over the last few months). I was hoping to pick up another album or a DVD while in the <a href="http://www.hmv.ca" target="_blank">HMV</a>, but it&#8217;s just a ton of sh__ out there. Oh well.
