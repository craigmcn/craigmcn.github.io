Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Here I is on my vacation &#8230; Woo Hoo! Definitely a more elated Woo Hoo than on a Monday, before work. pbthhh. Thanks, Wublub for the vacation happy wishes.

I went to my friend Juicy&#8217;s wedding on Sunday, after a stagette on Friday and the rehearsal and a dinner on Saturday. I had a great time. I had a handful of fantastic discussions with a handful of VERY intelligent people. I bagpiped for the procession and recession, and then piped for KC who did 2 highland dances. It has been about 15 years since I piped for (a) dancer(s), but it went okay. I think I might have played a little fast, but KC didn&#8217;t say anything. We had a wicked dinner with this amazing butternut squash soup &#8230; O..MY..GOD! Juicy and J burned their own CDs for the music, and the mix was really well done. Good job! They had their gift opening today, and I have yet to get them something .. I was preoccupied with getting the bagpiping ready .. but Juicy called today to make sure they hadn&#8217;t lost my gift. It was a little awkward to have to say, &#8220;No, you didn&#8217;t lose it, it wasn&#8217;t there.&#8221; But it&#8217;ll all work out. My main problem was that they have all kinds of stuff already, so from their gift registry, to spend what I would have spent, I would have ended up getting them a ton of cake pans, muffin pans, cookie trays, etc. which I didn&#8217;t want to do. So I&#8217;ll think of something.

I went to _Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan_&#8216;s performance of Billy Shakespeare&#8217;s _Much Ado About Nothing_ on Saturday afternoon, with my sister and niece. Fantastic. Brad Grass, while my dad thinks he is just a clown, did well as a clown-ish character (Benedick) in this comedy. _Shakespeare on the Saskatchewan_ always set their plays in times and locales specifically different from Elizabethan England, this one was set in late-19<sup>th</sup> century western Canada. The soldiers were NWMP soldiers fighting American whiskey traders. Pretty cool.

Well, that&#8217;s it for now &#8230; enjoy work!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
