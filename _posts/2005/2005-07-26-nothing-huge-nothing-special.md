Nothing huge, nothing special &#8230; just a quick note that the [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/) website is fully operational. And with this major endeavour behind me—sort of, I&#8217;m sure [h! is for Hulk](http://www.ppfhouse.com/animation.php) will find more work for me—I can get back to the projects I had on the go. Like getting the CFL stats back on the site—I forgot that I had changed the layout of the site after the regular season had finished—and getting back to crackerMail v2.0 development. You people laugh, I know, but crackerMail is the only webmail program (that I and many others have found) that allows easy navigation of multiple mailboxes. It&#8217;s functionality is going to be expanded exponentially with v2.0 &#8230; including allowing both POP3 and IMAP servers and configurable ports, as well as fuller attachment, reply and forwarding handling. Nyah nyah! I built a cool webmail program and you didn&#8217;t!!

**Update:** I had the CFL stats back up, but found out that whatever I did looks like s&#8212; in [Internet Explorer](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx) &#8230; I&#8217;m working on it! &#8230; Okay, it&#8217;s fixed. Wow! Internet Explorer is a real pain in the ass &#8230; Yay, [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/)!!
