Big Cracker reporting from <span style="font-weight: bold;">Our Nation&#8217;s Capital</span>!

So, I&#8217;m in [Ottawa](http://www.ottawa.ca/), also known as [The National Capital Region](http://www.canadascapital.gc.ca/), or NCR. I&#8217;m in town for [Remembrance Day](http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/other/remember/r_intro), hoping to get a photo of our new [GG, Michaëlle Jean](http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=14615) and our Right Honourable Prime Minister, [Paul Martin](http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/bio_former.asp?id=62).

But my blog today is specifically about [The Black Eyed Peas](http://www.blackeyedpeas.com/home/bio) song [My Humps](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackeyedpeas/myhumps.html). Have you heard this song? The lyrics are horrible. This is easily one of the most negative songs I&#8217;ve ever heard!!

> They say I&#8217;m really sexy,
  
> The boys they wanna sex me.
  
> They always standing next to me,
  
> Always dancing next to me,
  
> Tryin&#8217; a feel my hump, hump.
  
> Lookin&#8217; at my lump, lump.
  
> &#8230;.
  
> My lovely lady lumps

Am I the only one who finds that offensive? There&#8217;s a whole lot more to the song, but it&#8217;s no different than the quote above. I can&#8217;t believe it!

In other news, I went and saw [Zathura](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0406375/) with [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/) and JAC. What a good movie. A lot of fun. Great for the kids. The only questionable line was, &#8220;Go get me a juice box, bee-yatch!&#8221; uttered by the 10-year-old when the game gives him a robot. Otherwise, I highly recommend it, for kids 8 and up, who aren&#8217;t afraid of creepy monsters.
