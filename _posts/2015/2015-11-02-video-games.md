This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Video Games_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Games_(song)) by [Lana Del Ray](http://lanadelrey.com/) from her 2012 album, [Born to Die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_to_Die_(Lana_Del_Rey_album)). The [Dixie Chicks](http://www.dixiechicks.com/) version is from a [2015 benefit concert](https://www.bridgeschool.org/concert/).

I follow the Dixie Chicks on Facebook and they were mentioned in a post, with a link to the video.
