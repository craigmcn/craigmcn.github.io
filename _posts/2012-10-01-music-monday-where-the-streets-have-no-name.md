I was reminded of the [Pet Shop Boys](http://www.petshopboys.co.uk/)&#8217; cover of [U2](http://www.u2.com/index/home)&#8217;s [_Where the Streets Have No Name_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_the_Streets_Have_No_Name) the other day and thought I&#8217;d share it on this Music Monday. We have the 1987 original from U2&#8217;s classic album [The Joshua Tree](http://www.u2.com/discography/index/album/albumId/4007), and the Pet Shop Boys&#8217; 1991 single.
