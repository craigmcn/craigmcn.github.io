I was out yesterday with a friend who&#8217;s a horse rider. She takes riding lessons and attends horse shows. Thinking about horses, this week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [America](http://www.venturahighway.com/)&#8216;s 1971 classic _[A Horse with No Name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Horse_with_No_Name)_, from their self-titled debut album, and just for good measure, [Patti Smith](http://www.pattismith.net/)&#8216;s _Horses_ from her [1975 debut album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_(album)) of the same name.
