So, it&#8217;s late Sunday night, and I have managed to accomplish at least some of what I wanted.

Saturday I got up early to go to the <a href="http://www.randomhouse.ca" target="_blank">Random House</a> book sale. At $1 for hardcover and 50Â¢ for softcover, I picked up $20 worth of books. <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> warned me that it would be a madhouse (A madhouse, **a madhouse!** &#8211; Charlton Heston, _Planet of the Apes_). And it was to a certain extent, but not quite the mad rush I expected.

Then <a href="http://trikie.tripod.com/" target="_blank">Trikie</a> and her friends went shopping for bridesmaids&#8217; dresses and bridal gowns. So Gwildor and I came to my place and wrote code &#8230; Yay! We made some solid headway on Externalgateway.com, and we should be up and running very soon. All the stuff is hiding in a development area, so it&#8217;s the same old crap when you take a look, but not for long!

And today, I got done a little more. Plus, I&#8217;m in the middle of adding some serious functionality to the Winamp Now Playing section. My sister asked me what it was all about (when it was just a listing of tunes that I&#8217;d listened to), thinking there should be more &#8230; so I&#8217;m adding some more. I&#8217;ll let you know.
