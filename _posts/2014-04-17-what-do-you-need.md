The title question was going to be, &#8220;What do I need?&#8221; But I think this can apply to most everyone, and I&#8217;m going to try to be proactive. I realized recently that I need to be told exactly what people need, I can&#8217;t be guessing. I need to make it clear that I expect to be told exactly what people need, and in return I will try to be clear about what I need. I can&#8217;t help solve problems when I don&#8217;t really know what the problem is, and I can&#8217;t expect to get that information if I don&#8217;t ask.

When [my relationship ended](http://craigmcn.ca/thoughtful-thursday-my-whole-world.html "Thoughtful Thursday: My whole world") several weeks ago, it was a very vague ending. And I was trying to let go of something that I wasn&#8217;t certain was over, and that I still didn&#8217;t want to be over. But I was left with questions and I was without my best friend, who had the answers. I felt very much alone and questioning a good part of myself.

I managed to get the answers I needed, though I may have inappropriately forced the issue. But it made me realize that I need to hear the words, and I need to make sure that my need is understood. Because when I all I hear is &#8220;for now&#8221; and the reality is &#8220;forever,&#8221; I need to know that. And I need it to be known that I need to know.

I don&#8217;t know why it took me so long to realize this. I worked for a time in a technical support call centre and I remember how difficult it was to get callers to properly explain their problem. We&#8217;d go round and round before it turned out an internet problem was actually a printer problem.

I&#8217;ve decided I&#8217;m going to try to be clearer in my personal and professional exchanges to make my expectations understood, so that there aren&#8217;t lingering questions, I&#8217;m solving the right problems and everyone gets what they need.
