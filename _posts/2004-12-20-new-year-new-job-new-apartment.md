Well, boys and girls, it&#8217;s late on a Monday night and it&#8217;s been over a week since I last posted. First, I&#8217;ll apologize for not posting more frequently (I apologize for that a little too often, I think&#8230;). Secondly, have a got a good excuse! Have any of you tried looking for an apartment? No? Nobody? Then **you** don&#8217;t know what I went through last week! (I&#8217;m well aware we&#8217;ve all been through it &#8230; many times.)

Anyway, long story short, after looking at a ton of crap, and the places I wanted not returning my phone calls, I&#8217;ve got a new place. At a nice section of town, a little far from some things, but super close to others. Two blocks from the <a href="http://www.famousplayers.com" target="_blank">movies</a>, <a href="http://www.starbucks.ca" target="_blank">Starbucks</a>, <a href="http://www.indigo.ca" target="_blank">!ndigo</a>, <a href="http://www.bk.com" target="_blank">BK</a>, <a href="http://www.lcbo.com" target="_blank">liquor store</a>. Three blocks from <a href="http://www.hooters.com" target="_blank">Hooter&#8217;s</a>, but only 1 from <a href="http://www.subway.com" target="_blank">Subway</a>. Right on the subway/bus route, near a mall &#8230; perfect. Except I have a roommate, which kinda sucks, because I live alone right now. In fact, I&#8217;m sitting in my _gonch_ (Wublub, that&#8217;s for you!) in my living room writing this! Excellent!

So, new year, new job, new apartment &#8230; let&#8217;s see if it works out. <del>Oh, and here&#8217;s a new side-project I&#8217;m working on that I&#8217;m excited about.</del>
