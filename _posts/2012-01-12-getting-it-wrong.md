Apparently, Seth Godin [got the Web wrong in 1993](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/01/i-was-wrong.html "I Was Wrong"). Not a surprise. I don’t think too many people could have envisioned a world of [Facebook](http://facebook.com "Facebook"), [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.com "Wikipedia"), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.ca/?&tag=thetecwriblo-20&camp=212529&creative=392021&linkCode=wsw "Amazon"), or [Google](http://google.ca "Google") back in 1993.

What I love about his post is the notion of getting better about announcing being wrong and learning from it.

> Politicians, of course, are terrible at this. They are never wrong, apparently, and when they are, spin instead of admitting it. Which not only hurts their trustworthiness, it prevents them from learning anything.

It’s so true and it drives me crazy! “My [heartfelt, racist] comments, or [deliberate, ill-timed, and inappropriate] actions, were misinterpreted ….” Why not just admit you screwed up and hope people forgive and forget?
