This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Somebody That I Used to Know_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_That_I_Used_to_Know) by
[Gotye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotye) from his 2011 album,
[Making Mirrors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_Mirrors). The [Walk off the Earth](https://www.walkofftheearth.com/)
version is from a 2012 performance.

Thanks to a very lovely friend who gave me the scoop from one of [CBC Music’s Under the Covers](https://www.cbc.ca/listen/cbc-music-playlists/369-Covers) features from last week.
