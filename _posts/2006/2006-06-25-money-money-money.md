Or maybe, [Mony Mony](http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1626) (&#8230; but the version by [Billy Idol](http://www.billyidol.com/)) &#8230; Anyway, I had an odd flash of brilliance this afternoon and I&#8217;ll apologize now that this thought is a little deeper than [Bud&#8217;s](http://budblog.frymybacon.com/?p=113); I know you guys don&#8217;t care for legitimate deep thoughts, neither do I, they&#8217;re not as entertaining.

Anyway, I was on the phone with Mommy and it occurred to me, &#8220;Why do large companies have to make so much money?&#8221; For example, I work for a large company that made 2 billion dollars last year. I realize that it&#8217;s only an American billion (a thousand million, instead of a British billion, which is a million million), but it&#8217;s 2 thousand million dollars. That&#8217;s a fuckin&#8217; shitload of money! They need to make it, because they need to pay dividends to their shareholders. But why do they need shareholders? The 2 billion is profit. Over and above operating costs, they made 2 billion dollars. So getting the work done is all paid for; this is 2 billion dollars more than that. So what do shareholders do? It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;re investors who paid to get the company going. And the buying and selling of company shares doesn&#8217;t make money for the company. So why do we need them? And if we don&#8217;t need them, then why do we need to make 2 billion dollars?

In other news, I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to find a new job. I hate working for the company and managers that I work for, so if anyone&#8217;s got any brilliant ideas, shout &#8217;em out!
