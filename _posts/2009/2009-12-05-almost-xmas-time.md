We&#8217;re well into December now and I haven&#8217;t written you guys a real note in over three months. I _have_ been a little busy, but not really, and noteworthy things have happened, but not really.

On my birthday, I let you guys know that Cracker&#8217;s Marbles came in second at Trivia Night at the Yard. Well, two weeks ago, Mike, Jess, and I (Mike & Ike & Crackers) finally won! The categories were pretty varied, with general trivia, [Oscar winners](http://www.oscar.com/), and gemstones as major ones. It was a little funy at the end, because they announced the second place winner first, with 46 points. Jess was slightly indignant, “But we had 49 points!” And, the winner is &#8230;.

In the picture, he&#8217;s chillin&#8217; under my sister&#8217;s desk while she works. We all need to get familiar with the dog&#8217;s bodily cycles (yes, you know what I mean!), but I think it&#8217;ll be good. Even if I&#8217;m crazy allergic!

And in even bigger news, I&#8217;m now gainfully employed! As opposed to being _painfully self-_employed. I&#8217;m a programmer in the [institutional research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_research) office of the local university. The work is pretty much what the wikipedia link says; naturally, I work on the website (which is not actually in production, yet), ensuring that the information is usable and accurate. I&#8217;ll also be working on a lot of product and project documentation as we get things ramped up. Apparently, the current incarnation of the office has a much-expanded scope from the last office, which was less than effective at providin useful information in a useful format. We&#8217;re out to shift the paradigm!

Anyway, with Xmas coming up, I&#8217;ve got some gifts to wrap and decorations to put up, so I&#8217;ll drop you a note sometime later. (Probably to let you know about all my awesome Xmas loot!)
