This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Folsom Prison Blues_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folsom_Prison_Blues) by [Johnny Cash](http://johnnycash.com/) from his 1957 album, [With His Hot and Blue Guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_His_Hot_and_Blue_Guitar). The [Everlast](http://www.martyr-inc.com/music/) version is from his 2008 album, [Love, War and the Ghost of Whitey Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_War_and_the_Ghost_of_Whitey_Ford).

I almost didn’t have anything for today. But I did a quick search for classic rock covers and found classic Johnny Cash. You might remember Everlast, or Whitey Ford, as the lead singer from a group called [House of Pain](https://youtu.be/KZaz7OqyTHQ). Good times!
