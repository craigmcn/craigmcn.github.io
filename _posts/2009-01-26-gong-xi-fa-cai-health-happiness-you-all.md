Happy Chinese New Year to all of you! 恭喜發財,紅包拿來

The traditional greeting for the Chinese New Year is, “Gong xi fa cai!” Which roughly translates as, “Congratulations and be prosperous!” I found the Chinese text above on Wikipedia. It actually says, “Congratulations and be prosperous, now give me a red envelope!” Referring, of course, to the [red envelopes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year#Red_envelopes) given as gifts for the new year.
