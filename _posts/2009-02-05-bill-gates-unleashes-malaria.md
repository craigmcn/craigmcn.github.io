I was looking for a sensational headline for this post, did it work?

Apparently, Bill Gates [released a jar of mosquitoes](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,488348,00.html) into the audience at the [Technology, Entertainment, Design Conference (TED)](http://www.ted.com/). His message was about the threat of malaria and that “[t]here is no reason only poor people should be infected.” I love it!

For a guy who seemed intent on taking over the world and forcing it to bow to the dominance of [his computer operating system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows), this is pretty clever and quite humanitarian. To be fair, I don&#8217;t think anyone (outside of malaria-prone areas) really has an idea of the magnitude, and the cost, of the problem.

When I went to Africa almost 15 years ago, I took [malaria medication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefloquine) with me. I had to start it before I left and continue for a couple of weeks after I got back. I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s not an option for people who live there all the time.

Bill Gates, for once, good on ya!
