Hey, Hey! And a WooHoo! You&#8217;ll notice my shiny &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; or &#8216;Recently Played&#8217; section on the right &#8230; yes, very nice &#8230; When I&#8217;m at home and <a href="http://www.winamp.com" target="_blank">WinAmp</a> is playing, it shows &#8216;Now Playing&#8217; and displays the last track that was played. You can click on &#8216;More&#8217; and find the last 10 tracks played. The best part is that when I&#8217;m not home, or not playing anything, it shows &#8216;Recently Played&#8217;. Is that cool or what?

Alright, I need to mention this, and don&#8217;t want to insult anyone, but whoever heard of a <a href="http://www.beatyourtruck.com" target="_blank">nitro-powered remote control car</a>? My buddy, J, was telling me about his new toy, the <a href="http://traxxas.com/products/models/nitro/4910tmaxxclassic" target="_blank">T-Maxx</a>, which is a crazy-fast, nitro-powered r/c car. I can just imagine what his wife is thinking. I know guys who get in trouble for buying <a href="http://www.maxim.com" target="_blank">Maxim</a> magazines!
