excerpt: I have decided that McGill listens to a lot of old ragtime music. He has an old-timey gramophone and some antique 78s that he plays. When questioned about it, he tells the story of his great-grandpa, Joe McGill, who was known as Ragtime Cowboy Joe, because he would sing his herd to sleep with ragtime music.

Alright, halfway through the month. While I have indeed been lazy about my writing, I haven&#8217;t been idle. But I also haven&#8217;t written anything that I could include as an excerpt for you.

I&#8217;m trying to follow some advice I got last year for NaNoWriMo: Just keep writing! If you have no idea where your story is going and you have another story in your head, write that one and then maybe turn it into a dream sequence, or some secondary character&#8217;s backstory. Whatever you have to do to pound out the equivalent of 1,667 words per day.

Thinking about that, I have decided that McGill listens to a lot of old ragtime music. He has an old-timey gramophone and some antique 78s that he plays. When questioned about it, he tells the story of his great-grandpa, Joe McGill, who was known as Ragtime Cowboy Joe, because he would sing his herd to sleep with ragtime music.

With this [short story about Joe](http://craigmcn.ca/petunia-and-the-vipers.html "Petunia and the Vipers"), I can keep writing and include it in my 50,000 word count, but not really be writing my novel. (About which I have few ideas.)
