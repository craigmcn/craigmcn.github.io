Just a quick plug for my <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canadavotes2004/studentvotes/maxsilverman.html" target="_blank">local NDP candidate, Max Silverman</a>Â &#8230; although I&#8217;m considering submitting a blank ballot, this guy impresses me. I can&#8217;t imagine that he&#8217;ll have enough presence to beat out the <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/MembersOfParliament/ProfileMP.aspx?Key=56033&Language=E" target="_blank">Honourable Joe Volpe</a> (Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development), who is the incumbent, but I wish him luck. I have yet to find a party leader who has consistently intelligent things to say, and who says the things that his party believes, not just what will get them elected. <a href="http://www.ndp.ca" target="_blank">Jack Layton</a> comes close to setting a party line, but <a href="http://www.liberal.ca" target="_blank">Paul Martin</a> and <a href="http://www.conservative.ca" target="_blank">Steven Harper</a>? Nice try. Paul Martin said the other day that he would step down if he broke any campaign promises. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! I literally laughed out loud, by myself, early in the morning in my apartment, I let out a great, big belly laugh. Yeah, step down, right. Steven Harper distances himself from comments by former Alliance members who toe the Alliance party line, and yet that&#8217;s his party. Do they let just anyone into this thing?
