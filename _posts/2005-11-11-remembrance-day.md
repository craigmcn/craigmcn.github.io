So it&#8217;s 12:30pm, I&#8217;m back from [Parliament Hill](http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/visitors/mainmap-e.asp) and the [**National War Memorial**](http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/general/sub.cfm?source=memorials/memcan/national/Memorial):

I took a stroll around the Hill and over to the [Centennial Flame](http://www.parliamenthill.gc.ca/batir-building/terrains-grounds/flmm-flm-eng.html)Â while the wreaths were being laid. It was pretty cold out, so I needed to move around a bit. I hopped on the wall surrounding the [East Block](http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/visitors/eastblockmap-e.asp) to get some pictures of the parade, then moved a little farther east to get my pictures of the [**]Governor General**](http://www.gg.ca/index.aspx) and the [**Silver Cross Mother**](http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=collections/books/silver05):<a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/GG_SCM.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3068" title="GG_SCM" src="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/GG_SCM-300x225.jpg" alt="Governor General and Silver Cross Mother" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/GG_SCM-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/GG_SCM.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>

And the [**Prime Minister**](http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/default.asp):<a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/PM.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3069" title="PM" src="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/PM.jpg" alt="Prime Minister" width="201" height="151" /></a>

It&#8217;s quite moving to be in Ottawa, on Parliament Hill, for Remembrance Day. It&#8217;s really the heart of the country; seeing the flags at half-mast on the Parliament Buildings and getting the sense that the whole country is involved is incredible.
