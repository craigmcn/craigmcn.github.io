&#8220;Hey, Big Cracker, I&#8217;m getting a message that my account is locked.&#8221; &#8220;Have your account unlocked, then login again.&#8221; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the password the same as the application password?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, but you need the account unlocked. You don&#8217;t need to change the password.&#8221;

&#8220;I had the manager change the application password, but the account is still locked.&#8221; &#8220;You need the account unlocked. You don&#8217;t need to change the password.&#8221;

Lesson: Just follow the instructions.
