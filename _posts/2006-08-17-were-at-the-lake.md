Well, actually, I&#8217;m home from the lake. Late Sunday morning, VeeDub&#8217;s bro&#8217;, Jock, and his wife, Doc, (yup, Jock &#8216;n&#8217; Doc) picked me up to take me up to &#8220;the Lake&#8221;, which was about a 2-hour drive straight north. I got in the door, took off my shoes and didn&#8217;t put them back on until yesterday around 11am. Woo Hoo!

I spent 3-ish days lounging, tossing an [Aerobie](http://aerobie.com/Products/Sprint.htm) or a football, splashing in the lake, soaking in the fire-heated hot tub, riding in boats, getting destroyed on an inner tube (more later), playing poker, eating pie and drinking beer (yes, hard to believe!).

The &#8220;destroyed&#8221; part was trying to ride the inner tube behind a speeding boat making loops over its own wake and bouncing me around &#8217;til I flew off. Mind you, I didn&#8217;t fly off as spectacularly as VeeDub, who skidded on his back on the water for about 20 feet when he went off.

That&#8217;s it, pure relaxation and a bit of a sunburn. Good Times!
