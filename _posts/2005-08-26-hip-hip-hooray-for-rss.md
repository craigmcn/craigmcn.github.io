So, Wublub mentioned (I don&#8217;t know, like a jillion years ago) that I have to put together an RSS feed for my blogs &#8230; Well, [it&#8217;s done](http://feeds.feedburner.com/craigmcn)!! You may have noticed a few changes over the past couple of weeks &#8212; titles, permalinks &#8212; well, those were for the RSS feed!! I also recently got hooked up with [gmail](http://mail.google.com/mail/help/about.html) ([Google](http://www.google.ca/) Mail) and they have a personlized home page where I can include a whole ton of RSS feeds. I know a few other people with the gmail, so now they can see my new blogs (like this one!) without having to go come to my site. I think that&#8217;s very handy.

And a quick congratulations to Wublub on his new job! Any one who gets a new job deserves a pat on the back. It&#8217;s not easy leaving a place when you have a decent paying job, and it&#8217;s tough making that commitment to start something somewhere else when you really don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s going to better than where you left &#8230; hmm &#8230; can I ramble a little more? Anyway, good on &#8216;im! If anyone else out there is contemplating a new job, good for you!
