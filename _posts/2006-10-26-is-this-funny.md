Supposedly this joke should be funny to folks in Saskatoon; I&#8217;m not so sure.

A man met a beautiful woman and he decided he wanted to marry her right away. She protested, saying, &#8220;But we don&#8217;t know anything about each other.&#8221;
  
He said, &#8220;That&#8217;s all right; we&#8217;ll learn about each other as we go along.&#8221;
  
So they were married and honeymooned at a very nice resort.
  
One morning, they were lying by the pool when he got up off his towel, climbed the 10-meter diving board and did a two and a half tuck, entering the water perfectly, almost without a ripple. This was followed by another dive, three rotations in the jackknife position, before he again straightened out and cut into the water like a knife. Then he went back and lay down on his towel.
  
His new bride said, &#8220;That was incredible!&#8221;
  
He said, &#8220;I used to be an Olympic diving champion. I told you we&#8217;d learn more about ourselves as we went along.&#8221;
  
Then she got up, jumped in the pool and started doing laps. She was moving so fast that the froth from her pushing off at one end would hardly be gone before she was already touching the other end of the pool. She did freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, even butterfly! After about thirty laps she climbed out and lay down on her towel, barely out of breath.
  
He said, &#8220;That was incredible! Were you an Olympic endurance swimmer?&#8221;
  
&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I was a hooker in Saskatoon and I worked both sides of the Saskatchewan River.&#8221;
