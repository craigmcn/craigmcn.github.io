Hoowah! Tuesday. Blech. Anyway, I rode my bike to work, in spite of the chance of rain. I bought a new lid yesterday, so my brains don&#8217;t get smashed in when some [Lincoln Navigator](http://www.lincoln.com/suvs/navigator/) sideswipes me on the road. (Yup, almost happened this morning.)

I went to see [Kung Fu Hustle](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373074/) over the weekend. Excellent! Cartoonish, in a way, but lots of fun. Lots of kung fu, with some good comic relief. I wasn&#8217;t expecting the subtitles, but as with any subtitled movie, you get used to it and it fades into the background after a while. Let&#8217;s say 8 out of 10 saltines.

And Externalgateway.com has a new customer I&#8217;m excited about. H! is for Hulk got in touch with me to let me know that his brother, DJ Leo, has an album coming out and they now need a site on which to advertise. Woo hoo!
