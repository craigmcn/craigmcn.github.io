Hunh, Sept. 11 came and went and all I had to say was that I needed a nap. Yeah, well, that&#8217;s about all I have to say. Except that I think we need to honour those lives that were lost and the ones lost since in the so-called &#8220;war on terror&#8221;. And to come to some conclusions about why such an attack would have been justified (in the eyes of the terrorists) and resolve the issues.

In other news, Sunday night I had the opportunity to see [The Last King of Scotland](http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tiff/features/tiff-lastking.html) at the [Toronto International Film Festival](http://tiff.net/). I had two free tickets from one of the women I used to work with and only [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/)&#8216;s sister JAC was interested. We managed to get in a little early because VISA Gold or Platinum card holders got priority seating (due to the venue being the VISA Screening Room); of course, I have one of each. It was a good movie, except that it was a drama and started off with a little too much comic relief and ended with a little too much horrific torture. Good performances all around, though.
