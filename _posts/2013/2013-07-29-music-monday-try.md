This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/)&#8216;s [Juno award](http://junoawards.ca/)-winning _[Try](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=98f462d5-c4d9-452d-b7c8-da7d2e42a4e0)_ from their 1987 debut album [Outskirts](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/outskirts/). While certainly their first, I think it&#8217;s also their most recognizable song. And one of my favourites.
