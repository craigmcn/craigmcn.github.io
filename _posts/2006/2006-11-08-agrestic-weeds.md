I&#8217;ve been watching [Weeds](http://www.sho.com/sho/weeds/home) via download through 2 seasons (22 episodes) now and until it came up on [Dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/)&#8216;s [Word of the Day](http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/) in my [Google homepage](http://www.google.ca/ig), the aptness of the name of the community, [Agrestic](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=agrestic), never occured to me. These TV show guys think of everything.
