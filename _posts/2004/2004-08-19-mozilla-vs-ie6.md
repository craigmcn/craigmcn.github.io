Hey Hey!! Here&#8217;s Big Cracker&#8217;s blog for this week .. month .. I don&#8217;t know. Like I said last time, I try to keep you guys up to date, but, man, does that ever not happen.

I&#8217;m getting pretty frustrated with Mozilla vs. IE6 .. in that, very few things are written for both, and yet that&#8217;s what I need. And there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m the only one in this situation. I want a pretty (as in nice to look at), easy-to-use script that gives me (and you) a WYSIWYG/HTML editor for these blogs and your responses .. but NO, that doesn&#8217;t exist .. well, not one that works all the time. I worked out most of the bugs in the one I&#8217;m using, so that I can post blogs, and (hopefully) you can post responses. But I tried to implement it in crackerMail (the web mailer I&#8217;ve built) and it didn&#8217;t work at all well&#8230; And, actually, I just tried using it to post this blog .. no go .. grrr.

Gwildor found a cool blogger, but it has some drawbacks .. and thus doesn&#8217;t do what I would want it to do .. but maybe I&#8217;ll check it out and see what happens.

I&#8217;m on vacation as of tomorrow, so some of you I will see for the first time in a long time, and others I won&#8217;t see for 2 weeks &#8230; enjoy yourselves!
