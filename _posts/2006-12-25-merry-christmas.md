Not much done today, except to fart around on the computer. The Xmas parcels from Daddy-o and from my sister have not yet arrived, so nothing to open, except the prezzies from Santa and Mommy. I got a beautiful framed print of [Pic Island](http://cybermuse.beaux-arts.ca/cybermuse/search/artwork_e.jsp?mkey=8476) by [Lawren S. Harris](http://cybermuse.beaux-arts.ca/cybermuse/search/artist_e.jsp?iartistid=2326) that I put up over my couch in my living room. With that and my newly re-upholstered _chair of destiny_ (more later), I think it might be time to start growing up. I was thinking about watching a good Christmas movie about the birth of the Saviour, but now there&#8217;s not enough time to get through [the Matrix](http://thematrix101.com/) before I shower and head over to T&T&#8217;s for dinner.

I spent my day playing with [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/bigmccracker), what a pain. The underlying [HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-html40-19980424/) and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/) is so badly written, it&#8217;s almost impossible to build a decent site.

Oh well, [Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!](http://www.christmas-tree.com/stories/nightbeforechristmas.html)
