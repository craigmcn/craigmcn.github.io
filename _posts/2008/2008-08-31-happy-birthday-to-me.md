I just want to thank everybody for the great birthday wishes. It&#8217;s too bad you couldn&#8217;t make it to the party; I think we had a pretty good time. Unfortunately, it was only Cyon and I rockin&#8217; out to the [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_II), but I know Nelson&#8217;s not a big fan of the GH.

I got some nice cards from family and friends, but my sister&#8217;s was the best. I won&#8217;t describe the card, the inscription&#8217;s not that important. What&#8217;s important is the audio on the card; it&#8217;s an excerpt of the HI-larious Abbott and Costello routine &#8220;Who&#8217;s on First?&#8221; The excerpt comes from [this version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sShMA85pv8M). But I&#8217;m more familiar with [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfmvkO5x6Ng). Take your pick.

**Update:** I fixed the video links. Would have killed you to let me know they didn&#8217;t work?
