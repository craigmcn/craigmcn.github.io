This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_It's My Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It's_My_Life_(Talk_Talk_song)) by [Talk Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_Talk) from their 1984 album, [It's My Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_My_Life_(album)). The [No Doubt](http://nodoubt.com/) version is from their 2003 album, [The Singles 1992&#8211;2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singles_1992–2003).

I ran across this in a "covers you didn't know were covers" [video](https://youtu.be/JGFlD2pbn00). I didn't know it was a cover.
