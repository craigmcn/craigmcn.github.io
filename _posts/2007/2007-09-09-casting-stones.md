I&#8217;m often amused and frustrated by the general public. My experiences often have to do with riding the [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/). This morning, on my way to [bagpiping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes), there was a HI-larious show.

One  gentleman, let&#8217;s call him Clippy, was trimming his fingernails with a nail clipper. (Yeah, kinda grody, but is it any worse than him biting his nails?) One young woman, we&#8217;ll call her Booky, was reading. One older gentleman, Ralph (&#8217;cause it doesn&#8217;t matter any more than the other two), was sitting quietly. Booky asked Clippy to &#8220;please stop doing that, it&#8217;s disgusting.&#8221;  (I silently agreed.) I was reminded of something about a &#8220;pot calling the kettle black&#8221;.

Ralph decided that he would weigh in and pointed out that maybe Booky shouldn&#8217;t be lying across two seats if she&#8217;s giong to be accusing someone of doing something unacceptable on the subway. The _discussion_ between Booky and Ralph escalated while Clippy stopped clipping.

I agree with Ralph: If you&#8217;re going to accuse someone of anything, maybe make sure you&#8217;re in the clear.
