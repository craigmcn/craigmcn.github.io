This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_As It Was_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_It_Was) by
[Harry Styles](https://hstyles.co.uk/) from his 2022 album,
[Harry's House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry%27s_House). The [Tate McRae](https://www.tatemcrae.com/)
version is from a 2022 performance for SiriusXM.

I heard the cover on the radio and thought it was pretty good. I didn’t realize Tate McRae is Canadian, which is even cooler.
