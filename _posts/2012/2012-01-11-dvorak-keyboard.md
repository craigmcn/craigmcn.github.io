I had hoped to learn to type quickly and without looking at the keyboard. I had also thought that once I had the fundamentals worked out, I might find a more appropriate keyboard to use.

I had learned that the Dvorak keyboard layout was better suited to modern typing, now that we’ve moved away from mechanical typewriters. I was interested to try to use it and see for myself whether it was any easier or faster.

Now that I think about it, though, I’m not the only one who uses any of my computers, so it may be more of an irritant to others, if I change the keyboard layout. Also, I would need to relabel the keys, so even if I could switch the computer keyboard settings quickly, changing the key labels would not be so easy.

So, while I still think that the Dvorak keyboard layout would be interesting and valuable to learn, I won’t be doing it any time soon.
