Referring to [a previous post](http://craigmcn.ca/mobile-blogs.html "Mobile blogs"), I&#8217;m able to email blog posts. I haven&#8217;t actually done it, but I can. I&#8217;ve now expanded on that and updated this site for mobile devices. I&#8217;ve stripped down pretty much everything on the site except for the main content and response function. For those of you enjoying me on your mobile devices, this should be a little simpler.

**Update (2009-05-31 11:00):** I&#8217;ve just updated things a little more to redirect mobile browsers automatically to the mobile site.
