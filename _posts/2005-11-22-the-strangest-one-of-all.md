So, easily the strangest thing of all time happened to me tonight. Well, I&#8217;ve probably mentioned &#8220;the strangest thing&#8221; before, but we&#8217;re definitely in new territory with this one. I decided on my way home from work that I would stop into the [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.ca/) at the [Indigo Books](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/storeLocator/storeDetails/278/) at [Yonge & Eglinton](http://www.renters.ca/renters/neighbourhoods/yongeandeglinton.htm) for a simple latte ($4 instead of $5). As luck would have it, one of the 2 comfy leather chairs beside the fireplace was free, so Big Cracker sat down. About halfway through the chapter of [my book](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/books/Mother-Tongue-English-How-Got-Bill-Bryson/9780688078959-item.html?ikwid=978068807895&ikwsec=Bargain+Books), and halfway through the latte, this young Vietnamese woman stops by and asks me to proofread her resumé. Then she asks whether the resumé&#8217;s any good, and whether I feel that there&#8217;s discrimination against non-Caucasians when it comes to hiring. The resumé&#8217;s quite acceptable, and no, I don&#8217;t feel there&#8217;s any discrimination, generally. But looking at the resumé, this woman must be at least my age, maybe a little older and went from being a nurse to wanting to be a retail store assistant manager. She got her B.Sc ([Nursing](http://bloomberg.nursing.utoronto.ca/)) in &#8217;95 from the [U of T](http://www.utoronto.ca/), then went on to take some courses in Fashion, Cosmetics and Esthetics in 2003.

One of her questions was whether I thought people might look down on her for wanting to change jobs mid-life. So I told her that I have a degree that I&#8217;m not using, I started working in hotels and now I write procedures manuals for frontline bank employees. Not exactly one coherent career path. All in all, quite a strange evening.
