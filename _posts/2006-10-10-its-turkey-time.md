Whoop-a-dee-doo! It&#8217;s Thanksgiving!

I went out to visit people in London (ON), and I feel guilty, because I didn&#8217;t visit everyone I should have. I intended to head out to [the Hammer](http://www.hamilton.ca/index.htm) to visit an old friend, and visit my cousins and my great-aunt, as well. But I was too lazy to call and organize anything, and I didn&#8217;t want to stress-out my 86-year-old, [post-polio](http://www.marchofdimes.ca/EN/programs/PolioCanada/Pages/default.aspx) aunt by just popping in.

I did manage an excellent dinner with my friend, Juicy, who&#8217;s at [Western](http://www.uwo.ca/) for her [MBA](http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/mba/). and her husband, JPuddle, and 1-year-old daughter, GW. Her mom and dad were in from [Saskamatoon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/) and her mom made the turkey. Delicious.

Then I spent the rest of the weekend hangin&#8217; with my uncle and aunt. We had [brunch](http://pilotflyingj.com/), went for a stroll down to [Sifton Bog](http://www.thamesriver.on.ca/Wetlands_and_Natural_Areas/sifton.htm), a beautiful wild area within [London](http://www.londontourism.ca/) and ate chicken, instead of turkey. Delicious all the same.

And my internet at home has been down since last Thursday, so the crackerMail development has slowed considerably. And I&#8217;m losing my mind, because I can&#8217;t download new TV shows (namely episode 1 of [My Name is Earl](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/)) and I can&#8217;t use [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/) to figure out who&#8217;s who in the few remaining downloaded shows I haven&#8217;t seen.
