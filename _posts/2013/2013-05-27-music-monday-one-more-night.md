This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/default.aspx)&#8216;s _[One More Night](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=90aa6afa-8cc3-4b55-aee7-84c4ed9b1b04)_ from their 2009 album, [The Things We Left Behind](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/discography/cd/br_AlbumDetails.aspx?albumid=5accd736-4c87-4fea-8b9b-7bb81df1428f&album=1#title_discography). This is easily my favourite song right now. And loved it when I saw them perform it live back in January. There&#8217;s something about the storytelling and imagery that lets me imagine exactly the characters and events.
