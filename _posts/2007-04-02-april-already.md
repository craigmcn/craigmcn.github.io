April fool&#8217;s? No thanks. But it _was_ Shuttergirl&#8217;s big 3-0 &#8212; party, party, party! A gang of folks went for [dosa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa) in [Rexdale](http://maps.google.ca/maps?hl=en&q=rexdale%20toronto&cr=countryCA&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&um=1&sa=N&tab=wl), then headed down to the [Magpie Café](http://toronto.ibegin.com/restaurants/magpie-cafe) <del>(sorry, I couldn&#8217;t find better links)</del>. I met up with them at The Magpie. It has none of the usual beers, sticking mostly with local microbrews, like [Mill St.](http://millstreetbrewery.com/), [Denisons](http://www.denisons.ca/) and [Black Oak](http://blackoakbeer.com/index.php/the-beer/), and Belgian imports. All very flavourful and tasty, but all that flavour makes them pretty heavy. I was fairly bloated after only 4 pints. And the price was right, between $5.50 and $6.50 for good, local brews; not significantly more than other premium brands anywhere else. Good times!

Oh, yeah, and I&#8217;m almost convinced that the <a href="rutr.php" rel="nofollow">Rrroll Up the Rim</a> contest is a giant scam. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m completely up-to-date, I may have missed a couple of coffees, but I defnitely haven&#8217;t missed any wins, and I&#8217;m at least 2 wins behind this time last year. I&#8217;m not impressed. I think I may just bring some ground coffee and a small [French press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_press) and make my own coffee at work.
