I&#8217;m supposed to be flossing regularly, but it&#8217;s not a habit for me. I&#8217;ve heard that it takes 22 times to form a habit and 100 times to break a habit. And I&#8217;m assuming that that means in a row.Â That is to say, if you do something every time you want to do it, it becomes a habit after doing it 22 times. And if you don&#8217;t want do something every time you normally would, you will need to not do it 100 times. So, here&#8217;s my dilemma: Will it take 22 times to form a habit of flossing every night, or will it take 100 times to break the habit of _not_ flossing every night?

On a side note, I&#8217;d like drivers to form a habit of signalling before they turn or change lanes.
