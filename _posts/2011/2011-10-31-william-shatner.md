I had originally written something when I was totally impressed by my [Evening with William Shatner](http://www.shatnertour.com/ 'How Time Flies: An Evening with William Shatner'). Not to say that I’m not still totally impressed, but it was a week ago, and now I don’t recall everything that was totally impressive and amazing about it.

I think the main thing that impressed me was all the different things he’d done. Nothing really beyond acting, except for a commerce degree from McGill University, but a lot of acting.

I always wonder where older actors come from, like [Jon Hamm](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358316/ 'Jon Hamm') in [Mad Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/ 'Mad Men'). I mean how does a 36-year-old actor just happen to be cast as the lead in a [shortly to be] critically acclaimed television show when I’ve never seen him before? Shatner was 35 when he started as [Captain James Tiberius Kirk](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk 'James T. Kirk') on [Star Trek](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Portal:Main 'Memory Alpha'). What did he do before that? He acted in school plays, worked for a theatre company, acted at [Stratford](http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/ 'Stratford Shakespeare Festival'), on Broadway, and in a huge number of movies and television shows throughout the 50s and 60s.

Even now, he still acts in television, makes documentaries, raises horses, and does [charity work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner#Charity_work). And he tells great stories. Funny, often self-deprecating, stories; interesting stories about his family, his relationships with other actors, or show business; and heart-warming stories about love, loss, and redemption.

The show had it all. I’m sorry to be so late posting this: his last two shows are this week in Toronto and Montréal.
