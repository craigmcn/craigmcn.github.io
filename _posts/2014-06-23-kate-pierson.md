<span style="color: #000000;">This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is two fun, silly songs featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Pierson">Kate Pierson</a> of <a href="http://theb52s.com/">the B-52&#8217;s</a>. I was out with a friend a few days ago and the B-52&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Shack">Love Shack</a>, from their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Thing">Cosmic Thing</a> album, was playing. We were trying to remember when the song came out. I suggested it was around the same time as <a href="http://remhq.com/index.php">R.E.M.</a>&#8216;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_of_Time_(album)">Out of Time,</a> because there&#8217;s some temporal connection in my mind between Love Shack and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_Happy_People">Shiny Happy People</a>.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">Well, it turns out there&#8217;s a two year gap: Love Shack was released in 1989 and Shiny Happy People in 1991. But it&#8217;s two years when I was in high school, so both songs were probably on the radio and played at high school dances at around the same time. I feel the connection is appropriate.</span>
