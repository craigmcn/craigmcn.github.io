And we all thought gas-electric hybrid cars were a new concept. Well, I [just found out](http://www.hybridcars.com/hybrid-coverup-1974.html) that in the year of my birth one [Victor Wouk built a gas-electric Buick Skylark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle#History).

This is what I&#8217;m talking about when I wonder [where all the flying cars are](http://www.viewaskew.com/newboard/messages364/1226.html). I believe I was promised in 1940s and &#8217;50s comic books that I would have a flying car by now.
