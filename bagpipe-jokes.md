This is a true story (reported by Reuters). Daniel McCaig, a worker at the Bombardier aircraft manufacturing plant in Toronto was annoyed at the move to lay-off 130 workers. So, dressed in his kilt, he hoisted himself three stories into the air on a crane and serenaded the factory with his bagpipes. He played Auld Lang Syne and other favourites for four hours &#8211; and responded to requests for particular tunes from his cheering workmates below. Afterwards, the company took him to court, claiming that the work stoppage had cost them C$200,000. However, the judge, exercising a considerable amount of &#8220;amazing grace&#8221; dismissed the case so long as McCaig did not serenade the Bombardier factory again. McCaig was helped by five law students from York University in Toronto who drew up a defence based on &#8220;constitutional ethnic issues.&#8221;

Origin of Bagpipes
  
Long ago, the Scots devised a fearsome battle tactic. As the Scots neared their enemies, they would take cats, swing them round and round above their heads. Then the cats would be sent sailing through the air and land, clawing and biting, among the Scot’s foes. This was very effective. Word got out of this fearsome stratagem, and soon just the sound of the cats, howling and screaming as they were whirled over the heads of the Scotsmen, was enough to send even battle-hardened foes into full retreat.
  
But the Scots began to run out of cats. So they invented the Scottish bagpipe as a substitute.
