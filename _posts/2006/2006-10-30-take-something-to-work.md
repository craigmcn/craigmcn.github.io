What a wacky coincidence! There was a news message on the intranet at work for [Take Our Kids to Work day](http://www.takeourkidstowork.ca/). I saw the intranet article just before I found [this funny Onion article](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/54595?utm_source=onion_rss_daily). It was a little creepy to find the parody within the same web surfing session as the real thing!
