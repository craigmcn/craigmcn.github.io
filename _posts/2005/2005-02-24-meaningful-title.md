Alright, well, I cleaned up the MP3 listing, and solved as many of the variances as I could find. The major problem is that there is so much in there that it is difficult to conveniently reduce loading times. I think it&#8217;s about where I want it for now, so take it or leave it!

Next step, the <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2065614/Making-An-RSS-Feed" target="_blank">RSS Feed</a>. I think I&#8217;ll need to modify the way I do blogs to be able to create a useful feed. Unlike many other bloggers, I don&#8217;t have a title on my blogs, just the date. As well, there&#8217;s no &#8216;description&#8217;. <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>&#8216;s description is just the whole blog all over again, which I don&#8217;t want,but I also don&#8217;t want to have to write a blog and then summarize it too, and come up with a meaningful title. I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll see.

I&#8217;ve got some stuff on the go for the Admin section of my site (that only I can see &#8230; unless you&#8217;ve hacked my site &#8230; you bastards!), namely a To Do list and an Upcoming Events section. Some of you may realize that I have not been sending out birthday or anniversary cards as much, that&#8217;s because I was using the calendar in <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/" target="_blank">MS-Outlook</a>. Now that I&#8217;ve moved to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/" target="_blank">Thunderbird</a>, I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://kb.hpwebos.com/wps/portal/kb/common/article/33529_en.html" target="_blank">Palm Desktop</a>Â (an earlier version, but pretty much the same) calendar, but that means I actually have to look at it (which, as you can just imagine, I don&#8217;t).

I plan on focusing on Pipersdoor.ca for the next little while, to get things up and running, since I&#8217;m at least 6 weeks behind right now. But that doesn&#8217;t mean other stuff won&#8217;t get done. I&#8217;m trying to curb my television viewing to allow for more web development time &#8230; we&#8217;ll see how that goes. I mean, really, it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s too much on anyway.
