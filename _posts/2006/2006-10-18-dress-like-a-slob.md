I meant to have this done yesterday, but it didn&#8217;t happen. It has to do with [a column](http://metronews.ca/news/141602/time-for-men-to-stop-dressing-like-joe-slob/) in the [free Metro](http://www.metronews.ca/) I get on [the subway](http://www.ttc.ca/). The writer advocates a &#8220;dress code in some form&#8221;. In my opinion, until we get into the silver lam√© jumpsuits (of [Forbidden Planet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0049223/) and [Lost in Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058824/)) or the more appropriate fashions of [Star Trek](http://www.startrek.com/), I think we should get a lot of leeway in how we decide to attire ourselves. I know people ([h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/), RLP and Wild Erbunch, to name a few) who really like to wear suits and dress up, where I prefer to dress down. T-shirts and cargo shorts are my predominant choice, with jeans coming in a distant second. I wear shirts with collars for work, but I try to ensure they can remain untucked. Cords, not dress pants. Ties, not a chance. Jackets, what_ever_.

I tried, [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) can attest, that I tried to wear decent clothes to work. What did it get me? I ridiculously high dry cleaning bill. That&#8217;s all. I didn&#8217;t feel better about myself; I didn&#8217;t perform any better at work. Why? Because it&#8217;s a frivolous activity. As the article writer mentions, maybe people could consider their environment when choosing clothing for a particular event, e.g., no hockey jerseys or NASCAR apparel, but that won&#8217;t necessarily mean suits and no jeans. I dress comfortably and have yet to feel inappropriately attired at any function.
