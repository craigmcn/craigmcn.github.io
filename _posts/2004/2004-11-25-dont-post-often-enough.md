Alright, alright. I know. I don&#8217;t post often enough. Settle down. It&#8217;s been a busy week &#8230; sort of.

I&#8217;m working on a new design for a website. I was studying for my bartending exam. I&#8217;m working on crackerMail v1.1. And I&#8217;ve got a new game I&#8217;m playing. Oh, by the way, I **aced** the exam.

I can&#8217;t tell you much about the game, because I&#8217;m bound by a non-disclosure agreement, but it&#8217;s pissing me off a little. And the fact that it&#8217;s pissing me off is pissing me off. I&#8217;m stuck on this mission where the bad guys keep giving me the beat down. I discussed my problem with a colleague who advised me that I needed to &#8216;level up&#8217; my abilities to coincide with my level of experience. Oooohh, no wonder. Yeah, bulls&#8211;t! I leveled up my abilities and got the beat down just as bad. The bad guys were leveled up too! Grrrr.
