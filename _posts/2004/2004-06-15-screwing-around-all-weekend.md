Here it is, Tuesday, and me screwing around all weekend and not actually getting stuff done &#8230; well, not exactly, I guess &#8230; I&#8217;ve got some pretty solid headway made on my login stuff for this site. Hopefully, within the week I&#8217;ll get everything working. There&#8217;ll be a pretty significant change to the functionality of the site, but not the overall layout. (I&#8217;m not creative enough to overhaul the layout.)

Of the 5 movies I&#8217;ve seen over the past 10 days, I&#8217;ve managed to write reviews for 2 of themÂ ([Timeline](/timeline.html "Timeline"), [The Day After Tomorrow](/day-after-tomorrow.html "The Day After Tomorrow")). And, hey, post some responses &#8230; I need some feedback on my writing/reviewing ability. I know some of you have been entertained by the same things I have, let me know what you think. I&#8217;m gonna keep doing this whether you like it or not.

And, notice that the Playoff Stats are gone. Sorry, but I&#8217;m pretty sure everyone is comfortable with Tampa Bay having won. I&#8217;m working on getting MLB and CFL stats working &#8230; those 2 sites are a little tricky to extract data from &#8230; I&#8217;ll get it.
