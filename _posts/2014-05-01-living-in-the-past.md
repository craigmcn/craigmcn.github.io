To me, it means we&#8217;re trying to live in the past. It means that regardless of the diminishing need for door-to-door mail delivery, and the increasing cost, we&#8217;re not willing to accept a necessary change in our lives.

The world changes. The world has never and will never stop changing. I can think of all kinds of industries and profession that have entirely or mostly disappeared because they&#8217;re just not necessary or no longer efficient given current technology. Unfortunately, it seems, mail delivery can be added to this list.

I was recently in the Dominican Republic and had the opportunity to see a sugar cane harvesting operation. Haitians are hired to cut the sugar cane by hand. Yes, there are great big machines that can do the job in a fraction of the time, but they&#8217;re expensive and Haitians aren&#8217;t. One of the reasons I also heard was that if the Dominicans bought the machines, the Haitians wouldn&#8217;t have jobs. This is poor reasoning in my mind, but I have to trust that it makes reasonable economic sense to the Dominicans.

I suppose if we&#8217;re happy paying a dollar (and more) to send a letter and also subsidize mail delivery with junk mail in order to have very well paid people bringing our mail to our doors, then I guess that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll do. But if we can start living in the present and planning for the future, I think we&#8217;ll find acceptable, efficient and effective methods of communicating without the need for personal delivery of physical items.
