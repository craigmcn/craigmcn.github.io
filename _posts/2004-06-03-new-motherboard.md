Boy, I didn&#8217;t realize I hadn&#8217;t posted in almost a week, but I guess my computer&#8217;s really only barely back in business. I got the new motherboard and 256MB of DDR RAM &#8230; the new motherboard has onboard audio, video and LAN, excellent. No. The onboard stuff interferes with my other stuff, so I can&#8217;t use my shiny ATI Radeon 7000 video card nor my NIC &#8230; oh, but the onboard LAN wouldn&#8217;t start this morning, so I couldn&#8217;t listen to <a href="http://www.freakradio.net" target="_blank">FreakRadio</a> &#8230; so, I get home from work and put the old NIC back in before I power the computer on &#8230; but now the onboard LAN decides to work, so I have to disable it so it doesn&#8217;t interfere with the NIC &#8230; grrrrrrr&#8230;.

And the new computer likes to power itself off now for no known reason, so I&#8217;m going to have to spend the next few days sorting that out &#8230; grrrr &#8230; I just tried again right now, it got through the boot-up, then shut off&#8230; grrrrrrr.

Anyway, congratulations to my cousin Fiona on her engagement. Her mother, my cousin Donna, called me Tuesday (?) to ask if I would bagpipe. Of course! And how much would it cost? For family and/or friends &#8230; not a penny!

<a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>&#8216;s got a solid start on the online Settlers of Catan &#8230; I&#8217;d like to say that _we_&#8216;re working on it, but it&#8217;s really all him. I&#8217;ve got a couple of ideas, but I think he&#8217;s probably got it under control. I&#8217;ll see what my puny brain comes up with over the next few days.

I&#8217;ve been having a good time at work &#8230; What!?! How&#8217;s that!?! &#8230; No, really, it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been playing with ASP again. The stuff I do is really kind of useless, but it makes me think and it takes my mind off the retards &#8230; again, I apologize to people who are legitimately mentally challenged.
