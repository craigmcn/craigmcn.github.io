Bad Blogger, bad! I was doing so well, a blog every day last week, then came the weekend and this week and, well, nothing. Unfortunately, really nothing happened this week. I mean, I guess that&#8217;s not completely true, but it sure feels that way. The only thing I&#8217;ve feel I&#8217;ve done was to keep up with [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s blogs. And even then Wublub was on it before me!

I did get Wublub to update his domain name servers, and then told him he needs to make it so I can post comments to his blogs and provide me with an RSS feed.

Lately the only websites I&#8217;ve been going to are ones on my RSS feed list, or the few that send me newsletters (but that&#8217;s only [DevShed](http://www.devshed.com/)).

Well, whatever, I&#8217;m working a half day today, but, shhh, no one&#8217;s supposed to know &#8230;
