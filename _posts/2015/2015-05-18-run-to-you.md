I had this planned for last week, I&#8217;m not really sure what happened. This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Run to You_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_to_You_%28Bryan_Adams_song%29) by [Bryan Adams](http://bryanadams.com/) from his 1984 album, [Reckless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckless_(Bryan_Adams_album)). The [Ryan Adams](http://www.ryan-adams.com/) version is from a 2014 performance at the [Arlington Theatre](http://www.thearlingtontheatre.com/) in [Santa Barbara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California).
