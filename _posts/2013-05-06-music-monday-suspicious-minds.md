Alrighty, I&#8217;m recently back from a week in Las Vegas, so it seems appropriate to include an [Elvis Presley](http://www.elvis.com/) cover. I could have gone with a few different ones. I&#8217;m partial to [_Can&#8217;t Help Falling in Love_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can't_Help_Falling_in_Love); even with my terrible singing voice, I once did a passable karaoke version. But I really like [Dwight Yoakam](http://www.dwightyoakam.com/)&#8216;s version of [_Suspicious Minds_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds). So here you go, one of [Rolling Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone "Rolling Stone")&#8216;s [500 Greatest Songs of All Time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Songs_of_All_Time "Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time"), released in 1968 and a 1969 number one hit, along with the 1992 cover for the _[Honeymoon in Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeymoon_in_Vegas "Honeymoon in Vegas")_ soundtrack.
