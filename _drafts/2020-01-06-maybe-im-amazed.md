This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Maybe I’m Amazed_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maybe_I%27m_Amazed) by
[Paul McCartney](http://paulmccartney.com/) from his 1970 debut album,
[McCartney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCartney_(album)). The [Faces](http://the-faces.com/)
version is from their 1971 album, [Long Player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Player_(album)).

This seems like a nice love song to start the new year. I like that McCartney released the original at the same time the Beatles broke up, and that Rod Stewart released a cover almost immediately.
