This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_1000 Arms_](http://www.bluerodeo.com/blue-rodeo-announces-1000-arms/) by [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/), the title track from their 2016 album.

This song really hit me yesterday. I was thinking about family and friends who’ve always been there when I needed them, especially over the last few years, and this song started playing. I really understood the feeling of having &#8220;1000 arms to bring [me] back around.&#8221; I want you all to know that you have 1000 arms to help you too.
