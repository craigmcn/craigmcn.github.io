This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Monkey Wrench_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_Wrench_(song)) by [Foo Fighters](http://foofighters.com/) from their 1997 album, [The Colour and the Shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colour_and_the_Shape). The [Judah & The Lion](https://www.judahandthelion.com/) version is from their 2017 performance on [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/video/judah-lion-bring-bluegrass-flair-foo-fighters-monk-257807).

You know I love bluegrass-y covers and I’ve [posted covers](/west-end-girls.html) from A.V. Undercover [in the past](/final-countdown.html). Well, this is another one.
