So this weekend I managed to see 2 celebrities riding the [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/). First, yesterday, I saw [James Gray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Rodeo#Band_members), the keyboardist for [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/about/) getting on the Spadina streetcar. And today I saw _Ned Buckle_ heading down the stairs in the Dundas West subway station. I know I should&#8217;ve gotten autographs, but I didn&#8217;t. I think Ned Buckle saw that I recognized him, but he didn&#8217;t say anything.
