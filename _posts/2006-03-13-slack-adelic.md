So, you&#8217;re all wondering, this Big Cracker idiot thinks he&#8217;s some kind of blogger, but we haven&#8217;t seen a new blog in over a week &#8230; Get to work, slacker!!

You have every right to be disappointed in me. Especially since I have really nothing to tell. I was going to buy [new shoes](http://www.payless.com/), nope, didn&#8217;t happen. I was going to see [Ultraviolet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/) and/or [Beowulf and Grendel](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0402057/) and/or [16 Blocks](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450232/) (&#8217;cause I love the [Bruce Willis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/)), mmm &#8230; nope, didn&#8217;t happen. I was going to find some [new fancy jewelry for my ears](http://jewelry.about.com/od/bodyjewelry/a/gauging_lobes.htm), once again &#8230; nope, didn&#8217;t happen.

I did manage to get to T&T&#8217;s birthday/planned birthday/housewarming yesterday, I arrived 1.75 hours late (for a 2-hour shindig). It was C&#8217;s 2nd birthday, H&O&#8217;s planned birthday (they&#8217;re twins who were expected right about now, but were actually born Dec. 29), and I guess since T&T didn&#8217;t have any kind of housewarming when they first moved to their beautiful new home, this was it. It was well-attended, with lots of delicious food and plenty of friendly, quirky company.

Then I went downtown for a [new CPU fan](http://www.canadacomputers.com/index.php?do=ShowProduct&cmd=pd&pid=009299&cid=FN.349) and some [Popeye&#8217;s chicken](http://www.popeyes.com/). When I installed the new fan, I found out that it wasn&#8217;t the CPU fan at all, but actually the case fan that was making all the ruckus! So, I may head downtown today for a new case fan &#8230; we&#8217;ll see, I still need shoes and a battery for my doorbell &#8230;
