It&#8217;s a sad day in Seattle this morning. There&#8217;s no [Superbowl XL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL) trophy to bring home. My niece is wearing black in school today, instead of her &#8220;12th Seahawk&#8221; t-shirt. Although, my sister&#8217;s happy that it&#8217;s all over. I made a comment last night that if the [Seahawks](http://www.seahawks.com/) lost, I&#8217;m sure it wasn&#8217;t a matter of errors or being completely dominated by a much stronger team. Well, unfortunately, I was wrong. It _was_ [a matter of errors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XL#Game_summary). I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s an honour just to play, and I believe they deserved to be there yesterday. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not easy to lose the biggest game of the year, even though there has to be a losing team.
