This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is _[Sweet Jane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Jane)_ by [The Velvet Underground](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground) from their 1970 album, [Loaded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_(The_Velvet_Underground_album)). The [Cowboy Junkies](http://www.cowboyjunkies.com/)&#8216; version is from their 1988 album, [The Trinity Session](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trinity_Session). Given that only part of the chorus and the melody are common, I might question that the Cowboy Junkies version is a cover, but apparently it is, and [endorsed by Lou Reed himself](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Jane#Cover_versions).

During a recent trivia night, only the first 15 or 20 seconds of the Velvet Underground version were played and my team all thought it would be some prog-rock song. Had another few seconds been played, I might have caught on.
