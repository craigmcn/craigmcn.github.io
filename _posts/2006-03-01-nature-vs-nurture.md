So here&#8217;s a discussion for the psychologists: Whether I&#8217;m naturally an asshole and/or whether my parents taught me better. Walking home from work, I passed a snowman. A very artfully crafted snowman, with a carrot nose and everything. Now there&#8217;s not a lot of snow around, so it must have taken some work to get the snow to make ol&#8217; Frosty. But did I think, &#8220;What a shining example of snowman architecture!&#8221;? Or even, &#8220;That takes me back to my delightful, carefree childhood.&#8221;? Nope. My first thought was, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;d be so much fun to kick that snowman&#8217;s head right off!!&#8221;

Obviously, I didn&#8217;t kick his head off, I&#8217;m not that kind of person, but what kind of jackass am I that it was my first thought?
