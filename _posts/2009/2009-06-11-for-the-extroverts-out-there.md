This is also for the introverts; to know that at least one other person understands our plight. A few years ago, [Jonathan Rauch](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/by/jonathan_rauch) over at [The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/) wrote a great article about [Caring for Your Introvert](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200303/rauch). I got the link from the [Your Writing Dept blog](http://www.yourwritingdept.com/blog/) on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/yourwritingdept). Basically, if we look like we want to be left alone, don&#8217;t try to &#8220;cheer us up,&#8221; just leave us alone. We&#8217;ll be back before you know it.
