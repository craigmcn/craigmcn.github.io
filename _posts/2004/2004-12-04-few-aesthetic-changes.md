So, I&#8217;m not sure if you can tell, but I&#8217;ve made a few aesthetic changes to the site &#8230; Did you notice? Are they any good? I&#8217;m having phun with Photoshop &#8230; making all kinds of nice little fancy graphics. (Should there be a comma in there somewhere?)

Oh, by the way &#8230; **WOOO HOOO!!** I _finally_ got a new job! I got a secondment position, I&#8217;m filling in for a lovely young lady on her maternity leave. I&#8217;ll be updating, reviewing, writing, etc. manuals for the front-line staff of my company (which has been in the news lately). I think it should be a lot of fun. I don&#8217;t start &#8217;til Jan 3 but I&#8217;ve got a project already that I can work on a few hours a day, to get accustomed to things _upstairs_.

And since now I&#8217;m staying in the Big Smoke, I&#8217;m looking for a new apartment. My sister&#8217;s friend lives in a house with a bachelor suite on the top floor which is available, so I&#8217;ll check that out. I definitely want to be more centrally located. I really enjoyed living downtown when I first moved to T Dot. Wish me luck!

**Update** I&#8217;m not kidding about the survey on the left &#8230; I&#8217;m really looking for some input on what else should go into the left-hand column &#8230; What do you think?
