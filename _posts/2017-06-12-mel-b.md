This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [Mel B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_B). [_Spice Up Your Life_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Up_Your_Life), from the [Spice Girls’](https://www.thespicegirls.com/) 1997 album, [Spiceworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiceworld_(album)) and [_Tell Me_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell_Me_(Mel_B_song)) from her 2000 album, [Hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_(Mel_B_album)).

This was intended for last week, but didn’t get posted. I think I thought it wasn’t ready and I didn’t really feel like getting it ready. But it was ready and I should’ve just posted it. Enjoy.
