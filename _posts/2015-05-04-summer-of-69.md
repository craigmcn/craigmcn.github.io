This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is Summer of &#8217;69 by [Bryan Adams](http://bryanadams.com/) from his 1984 album, [Reckless](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reckless_(Bryan_Adams_album)). The Ryan Adams version is from a 2015 gig at the [Ryman Auditorium](http://ryman.com/) in Nashville, but I&#8217;m not sure I dig the chick who&#8217;s giggling the whole way through. Apparently, in 2002, [Ryan Adams ejected a fan from a concert](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73812/ryan-adams-not-amused-by-name-game) at the Ryman for requesting the cover. Personally, I think it was pretty hilarious.
