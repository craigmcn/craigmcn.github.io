Woo Boy! Sunday afternoon, and I&#8217;m roasting like never before &#8230; well, not since last week, anyway. This town is so bloody hot, I don&#8217;t how or why people live here. And the temperature wouldn&#8217;t feel so hot, if the humidity weren&#8217;t 100% and if the air actually moved &#8230; I mean, there is <span style="font-weight: bold;">no</span> breeze whatsoever!! It&#8217;s absolutely unbearable. Most people I know have air conditioning and when I tell them I don&#8217;t, they say, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; But I don&#8217;t think they understand that I sweat all day, everyday when I&#8217;m in my house. I go to work to get into an air-conditioned building. And any exercise I was hoping to get by riding my bike &#8230; fuhgeddaboutit!! I can&#8217;t barely walk, let alone expend the energy riding. Not to mention the great buckets of sweat that would pour off me!!

Oh and by the way, did I mention it&#8217;s hot outside?
