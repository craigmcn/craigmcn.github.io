Just a quick update. [Chowarmaan](https://twitter.com/chowarmaan) suggested, quite a while ago, that I include my full blog in the [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)) and [Atom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(standard)) feeds, so that when he used [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/), he could read the whole blog. Well, I&#8217;ve done that.

I&#8217;ve gone back through the [PHP](http://www.php.net/) scripts I wrote to build the feeds to ensure that they work properly. Plus, I rewrote them so that they can run as [cron jobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) and they&#8217;ll build &#8220;static&#8221; [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) files.

The current feed URLs will redirect to the new files and the right-hand menu has been updated, but here are the new feed links anyway:
