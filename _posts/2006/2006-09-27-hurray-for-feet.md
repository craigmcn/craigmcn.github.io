Whew, it was close, but General Bloodglutton had some special healing powder that [re-attached my foot](/dorky-dork-dork.html). Also, the whole group of us are wicked famous now for capturing Black Jaguar. The Grand Revered Speaker, Great Snarler, had a giant hate on for Black Jaguar and we allowed him to exact revenge, of a sort. We also returned a golden medallion that BJ stole from Great Snarler&#8217;s son. Since we&#8217;re so humble, we would accept no reward, which only made us more honourable. We all got super-duper experience points for our adventure and behaviour.

In other news &#8230; ummm &#8230; sorry, no other news, just the dorkitude of [D&D](http://www.wizards.com/Dnd/). And an apology to my other adventuring companions, Beldak Dagarkin, Dwarf fighter, still lives on inÂ the pages of a [v.3.5 character sheet](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/charactersheets), so he can return to the adventure any time!
