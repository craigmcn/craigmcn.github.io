I have recently signed up as an Amazon Associate, which means that I have Amazon widgets on all my websites (bigcracker.ca, [craigmcnaughton.ca](http://www.craigmcnaughton.ca/), thetechwriterblog.com and thewebdevelopersblog.com). When you use the search widget or click the items in the display widgets, you&#8217;ll be taken to the Amazon.ca website. If you complete a purchase while still on the site (having come from one of my sites), I get a small commission.

If you shop at Amazon regularly, and want to help a good friend make a couple of extra bucks a month, use the widgets, or bookmark [this link](http://www.amazon.ca/?&tag=thetecwriblo-20&camp=212529&creative=392021&linkCode=wsw) (<http://www.amazon.ca/?&tag=thetecwriblo-20&camp=212529&creative=392021&linkCode=wsw>).

Thanks, everybody!
