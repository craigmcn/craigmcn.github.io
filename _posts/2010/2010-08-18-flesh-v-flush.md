I noticed this posted on [Daily Writing Tips](http://www.dailywritingtips.com/fleshing-out-and-flushing-out/), but didn’t really think it was a thing until my boss said it the other day, “flush it out,” meaning that we would work out a response or solution.

For reference:

> You flesh out a plan.
>
> You flush toilets and flush out toxins.
>
> You flush out game or people who are in hiding.

Mostly, I don’t think anyone should be flushing out their plans.
