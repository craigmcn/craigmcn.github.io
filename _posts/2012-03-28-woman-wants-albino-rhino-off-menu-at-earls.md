[Woman wants ‘Albino Rhino’ off menu at Earls](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/03/26/bc-albinism-menu-complaint.html)

Seriously? I’ve been consuming Albino Rhino beer for close to 20 years. Not once did I associate it with discrimination against people with [albinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albinism "Albinism"). I suppose [‘Albino Wing Wednesdays’](http://www.earls.ca/food-menu/bar-menu/daily-features/wednesday "Albino Wing Wednesdays") may be pushing it a little, but only out of context. In fact, I would hope that someone coming from Nigeria, having experienced the threat of persecution for her condition, might be relieved to know that it’s not an issue, and that in 25 years, no one ever considered it to be one.
