A&M were driving me back to my car and we got sandwiched between a mini-van turning right from the left lane and the utility pole at the corner of the street. No injuries, the vehicles could still be driven and there was a independent witness who confirmed that it was the minivan driver&#8217;s fault and not A&#8217;s. A little damage to the front, driver&#8217;s side <a href="https://cdn.craigmcn.ca/img/front-driver-2.jpg?x-request=xhr" data-fslightbox="lightbox">fender</a> and <a href="https://cdn.craigmcn.ca/img/front-driver-1.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">lights</a>, and the front, passenger&#8217;s side <a href="https://cdn.craigmcn.ca/img/front-passenger-1.jpg?x-request=xhr" data-fslightbox="lightbox">fender</a> and <a href="https://cdn.craigmcn.ca/img/front-passenger-2.jpg?x-request=xhr" data-fslightbox="lightbox">wheel</a>.
