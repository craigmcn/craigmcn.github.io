So I had a very surreal experience last night &#8230; several pints with my boss&#8217;s boss. There were other people there &#8212; it was a celebration for one woman in the office &#8212; but the surreal experience was due to the boss. She started with a [Kilkenny](http://www.kilkenny.ca/) and moved over to the [Moosehead](http://www.moosehead.ca/) on tap, since the Kilkenny was from a can (with a widget, so fully acceptable), I started with and stayed on the [Rickards&#8217; Red](http://www.bottledbeer.co.uk/index.html?beerid=1571). Now, you may have read some derogatory comments <del>(or these)</del> from [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), and I generally have to agree with them, &#8217;cause she really pisses me off sometimes, too. But we had a somewhat interesting conversation (I think the beer had my tongue wagging a little too much!) and she actually managed to inspire me! My philosophy is that if information is on a computer, you can put it on the internet. And we have a huge amount of information at work that the boss wants to make available on our intranet site, but she&#8217;s been told that it&#8217;s impossible. Again, I say if it&#8217;s on a computer, it can be put on the internet. So she basically challenged me to figure out a way to get this information onto the intranet. I was so inspired that I had to email Gwildor as soon as I got home. He had said more than a month ago that there should be a way to do it, but I was rather disillusioned with my work and wasn&#8217;t willing to get on board. Well now I am! &#8230; Good luck to us!

In other news, I found out my [Chinese name](http://www.mandarintools.com/chinesename.html) (Mandarin, I believe) is Ma Kuo rui &#8230; something about expand, enlarge and sharp, maybe [h! is for Hulk](http://www.ppfhouse.com/animation.php) can tell me what it means. [Check it out](http://www.mandarintools.com/chinesename.html) for yourselves!

Oh, and I **need** to post a note about how great a guy Gwildor is. We&#8217;d had a good time doing some [CoD](http://www.callofduty.com/)&#8216;ing <del>and, well, I&#8217;ll let him tell you</del>.
