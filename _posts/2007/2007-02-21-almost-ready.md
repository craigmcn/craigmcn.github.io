So, I&#8217;ve got the back-end database structure worked out for the [Rrroll up the rim](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/) stats, I just need to work out the interface. I&#8217;m going to make you log in, so I don&#8217;t get a bunch of bullshit flying in. I&#8217;ll move the [Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/) banner to the bottom (replacing the French one) to make room for the stats, which will have pretty bar graphs. I&#8217;m excited.

In other news, I obviously left Winamp playing on the &#8216;puter at home. So, even though it shows Now Playing, I&#8217;m not actually at home listening. (The computer&#8217;s on to download seasons 2, 3, 4 and 5 of [Charmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmed) and the most recent episode of [NCIS](http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis/).)
