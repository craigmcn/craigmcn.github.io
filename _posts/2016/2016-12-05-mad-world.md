This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Mad World_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_World) by [Tears for Fears](http://tearsforfears.com/) from their 1983 album, [The Hurting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurting). The [Postmodern Jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORIeT1hk6tYBuntEXsguLg) version is from a 2015 performance.

I&#8217;ve been thinking of using [Gary Jules' cover](https://youtu.be/4N3N1MlvVc4) of this song, which was featured in the movie Donnie Darko. I don't know why I haven&#8217;t, but I found this cover and think it&#8217;s pretty solid too.
