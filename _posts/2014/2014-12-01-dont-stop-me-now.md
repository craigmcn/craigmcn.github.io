This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is _[Don&#8217;t Stop Me Now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Stop_Me_Now)_ by [Queen](http://queenonline.com/) from their 1978 album, [Jazz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_(Queen_album)). The [Foxes](http://www.iamfoxes.com/) version is from an October 2014 [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006q2x0) episode, [Mummy on the Orient Express](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04lny6c). For some reason, this was an earworm for me the other day, so I&#8217;m sharing it with you.
