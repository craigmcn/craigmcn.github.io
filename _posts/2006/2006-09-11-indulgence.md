I obviously indulge myself a little much on weekends. Often enough on Saturdays and Sundays, I feel like having a nap around 1:30pm or 2:00pm, and so I have a nap, &#8217;cause, hey, I live by myself and have few responsibilities (sorry). But here I am at work and I feel like having a nap and I can&#8217;t! Which means that I&#8217;ll be tired when I get home and will doze off on the couch for an hour and then not want to do anything else all night. Well, maybe it&#8217;s time to grow up.
