&#8220;I got a brand new pair of roller skates, you got a brand new key &#8230;&#8221; Okay so the song isn&#8217;t about what I&#8217;m writing about, but whatever &#8230; Woo Hoo! Big Cracker&#8217;s got a wicked new bike! A <a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/928-4948-1-PB.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">Schwinn 5-Star Cruiser</a>! It was feeling a little funny riding to and fromÂ work yesterday, so I raised the seat and the handlebars this morning and it rides like a dream! Now I just need to get rid of the chest pains! Wow, am I out of shape!

[Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com) and I went to a [Toronto Rock](http://www.torontorock.com) lacrosse game Sunday afternoon and were somewhat disappointed by a lacklustre performance in the first 53 minutes of the 60-minute game. This was the final game before playoffs and Toronto has already earned its playoff berth, so they played as though they really didn&#8217;t care. It wasn&#8217;t until the last 7 minutes when they were down by 7 points that they decided that they had to win &#8230; So they came back to win 14-13. Gwilly had written off the game at 48 minutes!
