A little late, I know, but here it is, Big Cracker&#8217;s adventure to [Medieval Times](http://www.medievaltimes.com/toronto/abouttheshow.aspx). For some reason, something to do with work, [Sonya](http://www.sonyamatteo.com/) had some spare (and super-cheap!) tickets to Medieval Times available. Since [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and [Smokey](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) didn&#8217;t want to go, I stepped up. The food was alright, but nothing to write home about. It was really the show that was the fun part. Although, I&#8217;m not sure that even with the show and food and ambience that the tickets are worth around $60; a little pricey for other than a one-time thing.
