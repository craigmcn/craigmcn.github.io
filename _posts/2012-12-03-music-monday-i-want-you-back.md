This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_I Want You Back_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Want_You_Back) from [The Jackson 5](http://www.thejacksons.com/home/). Released in 1969, it was the band&#8217;s first single on a major label. [KT Tunstall](http://www.kttunstall.com/) covered the song live on the New Year&#8217;s Eve 2005 episode of [Jools Holland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jools_Holland "Jools Holland")&#8216;s [Hootenanny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hootenanny_(UK_TV_series)). I think I like Tunstall&#8217;s version because she sounds more like a man than Michael Jackson.
