I managed to catch a _special_ double feature on the weekend, [The Wicker Man](http://thewickermanmovie.warnerbros.com/) and [Snakes on a Plane](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417148/).

The Wicker Man was ho-hum. [Nicolas Cage](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000115/) was overacting, as he tends to do and making what seemed to be calm, rational situations into a whole lot of shouting. [James Franco](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0290556/) has a short cameo at the end that&#8217;s kinda fun, but it&#8217;s overshadowed by the reason behind: a terrible ending to Nic Cage&#8217;s character&#8217;s situation, especially since he&#8217;s built up as a such a tragic hero. [Molly Parker](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0662504/) plays a fun, interesting role as a schoolteacher, and [Kate Beahan](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0063571/) is sexy, but her character is oddly suspicious and detached. 6 saltines out of 10, for the crappy ending and Nic&#8217;s overacting.

[&#8220;I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417148/quotes) That pretty much sums it up. Snakes on a Plane is exactly that. There&#8217;s a whole lotta snakes biting and spitting and slithering and constricting and generally fuckin&#8217; shit up. There&#8217;s a little action, a little suspense, some solid comedy relief, but for the most part, slithering, biting snakes in a confined space. It&#8217;s kinds creepy and kinda funny, but pretty much fun. And apart from all the dead people, it all turns out okay. Good times! 8 out of 10, for silly cheesiness.
