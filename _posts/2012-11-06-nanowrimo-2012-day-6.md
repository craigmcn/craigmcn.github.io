excerpt: "Oh my god, I backed over her by accident and squashed her head flat, but it was an accident and I didn't know what to do, so I chopped her up into tiny pieces and put her in my neighbour's garbage can and lied about it the whole time when you came asking me questions."

Boy, I&#8217;m so glad that I&#8217;m writing about a serial killer.

It drives me so nuts when I see these shows where the victim was killed in some horrible way and then was disposed of in some  equally horrible way and the police spend all their time trying to figure out what happened and they talk to a bunch of people and everyone says they don&#8217;t know anything about it, but it&#8217;s totally horrible and then the cops uncover some magic weirdness and the first person the cops talked to is all, “Oh my god, I backed over her by accident and squashed her head flat, but it was an accident and I didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I chopped her up into tiny pieces and put her in my neighbour&#8217;s garbage can and lied about it the whole time when you came asking me questions.”

I&#8217;m not going to write a scene like that. Unfortunately, today did not see a good excerpt-able scene written. So, nothing to share today.

But for those of you who don&#8217;t know what these posts are all about, I&#8217;m trying to write a 50,000-word novel in the 30 days of November. It&#8217;s called National Novel Writing Month, or [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/en/) for short.
