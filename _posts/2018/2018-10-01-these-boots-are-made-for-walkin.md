This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_These Boots Are Made for Walkin’_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/These_Boots_Are_Made_for_Walkin%27) by [Nancy Sinatra](http://www.nancysinatra.com/) from her 1966 album, [Boots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_(album)). The [Jessica Simpson](http://jessicasimpson.com/) version is from the 2005 [Dukes of Hazzard soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dukes_of_Hazzard_(film)#Soundtrack).

This gets filed under "garbage covers" because it’s so awful. Somehow a song about empowering women got turned into a garbage sex adventure with bullshit lyrics.
