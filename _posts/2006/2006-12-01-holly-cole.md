Yeah, yeah, so this is dated Friday and I wrote it Monday, sue me. I was fartin&#8217; around with other stuff all weekend and never got this done.

Daddy-o got me a ticket to the [Holly Cole](http://www.hollycole.com/) show at [Roy Thompson Hall](http://www.roythomson.com/) for my birthday. Thanks, Dad! And what an excellent show. With that sultry, sexy voice, she could sing the ABCs and sound amazing. My only issue is that it was a Christmas show. I&#8217;m a bit of grinchy scrooge at Christmas, other than gifts and cards. [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) can attest to my vehement opposition to Christmas decorating. I will give Ms. Cole credit, though, the Christmas selections were rarities and were interspersed with some of her classics (_I Can See Clearly Now_ and _Cry (If You Want To)_) and some other seldom-heard tunes. She was accompanied by a full orchestra along with her band. The pianist ([Aaron Davis](http://home.ca.inter.net/~ttoyooka/hollycole/aaron.html)) had written all the orchestral arrangements, which sounded excellent.

Good job! 8 out of 10 saltines!
