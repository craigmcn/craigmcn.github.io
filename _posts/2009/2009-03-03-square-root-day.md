Apparently, today is [Square Root Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_day). I found this out this morning on [CBC Radio 2](http://www.cbc.ca/radio2/), [Tom Allen](http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/personality/tom_allen) felt the need to mention it. He also happened to mention that it only happens nine times each century. Of course, I was hearing this as I was waking up, so it didn&#8217;t dawn on me that it would be impossible for it to happen more than nine times in a century.

If you haven&#8217;t checked the Wikipedia link above, the reason that today is Square Root Day is because both the month and the day are the square root of the year (3, 3, 9: 03/03/2009). Obviously, this can only happen nine times, because by the tenth time, we&#8217;re into a new century, or we&#8217;re into the year 00, which wouldn&#8217;t count.

Interesting, though, eh?
