It&#8217;s [Rrroll up the Rim](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/index.php) time again. I still haven&#8217;t paid Veedub for last year&#8217;s staggering defeat, but I&#8217;ve got some gift certificates saved up, so it&#8217;s all good. I think I mentioned that I would try to set up more inclusive statistics, but I haven&#8217;t started yet. Record your numbers, or e-mail me with your results every so often and I&#8217;ll try to get something up-and-running this week.

My first medium, single milk was a dud. I&#8217;m 0 for 1 already.
