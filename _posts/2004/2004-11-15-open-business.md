**WOO HOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!**

This is to let you know that Externalgateway.com is open for business!!

After a lot of hard work, sweat and tears, it&#8217;s looks good! Not necessarily exactly what we were going for, but I like it. (And since the design is mostly me, that&#8217;s really all that matters!)

Apart from that, I think I&#8217;ll talk to the girl in my bartending class (I&#8217;ll call her A) and take her up on her offer of a blind date. I&#8217;m definitely not big on blind dates, but what the hey. I&#8217;ll let you know what happens.

Oh, yeah &#8230; boo hoo .. the Saskatchewan Roughriders failed to make it to the Grey Cup finals. I&#8217;m a little disappointed, but I&#8217;ll take solace in the Toronto Argonauts having made it. Boy, Montr√©al must be pissed.
