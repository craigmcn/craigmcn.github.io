What&#8217;s with the giant surge in social networking? I finally got myself a [MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/bigmccracker) a few months ago and am still a month behind in the blog posts. I also have only 9 friends (which is pretty accurate), so I&#8217;m wondering why I bother. I even denied someone&#8217;s Friend request, since I didn&#8217;t know the dude, but then there was a message from him lauding crackerMail. (I asked him to re-send the request.) Now I&#8217;m hooked up with [Facebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook); [Shuttergirl](http://www.my-dot.blogspot.ca/) finally nudged me over. I had invites from [Bud](http://www.glenhowie.com/) and Chowarmaan, [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) hooked himself up thanks to them, and at Shuttergirl&#8217;s b-day I heard bucketloads about Facebook this and Facebook that.

I&#8217;m still not entirely sure why I need either. I&#8217;ve got a page that is my space. I call it [bigcracker.ca](http://www.bigcracker.ca/). Everything that I want to make available on the interweb is on there: me bitching on a regular basis. I&#8217;ve started putting a link to my real blog posts in my MySpace blog posts (obviously, I&#8217;m just transferring them over; I&#8217;m not writing new ones). I haven&#8217;t even figured out what Facebook is for. Oh well, I&#8217;ll jump on the bandwagon and stay &#8217;til the wheels fall off.
