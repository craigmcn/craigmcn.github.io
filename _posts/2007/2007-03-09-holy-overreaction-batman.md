So I&#8217;m walking across the mall parking lot to work this morning. At the end of the mall, there is a fairly narrow driveway with a mostly blind corner. Invariably, some jackass flies around the corner (past the poorly marked stop sign) and then has to come to a screeching halt because of other traffic or pedestrians. And that&#8217;s what happened this morning.

From my perspective, drivers have 2 choices: either come flying around that corner and risk the consequences, or stop at the stop sign and proceed cautiously around the building. This dude comes flying around the corner and stops in my path about 2 or 3 metres (3 or 4 steps) away from me. I stop and mutter under my breath, &#8220;Keep movin&#8217;, for Chris&#8217; sake&#8221;, and then proceed to walk around the tool and his car.

I&#8217;ve got my Walkman playing so I&#8217;m not exactly paying attention to what&#8217;s going on around me, but I sense a commotion of some kind behind me. The dude gets out of his car and yells at me, &#8220;What did you say? What did you say to me?&#8221; So I take off my headphones and say, &#8220;I said, &#8216;Keep moving.'&#8221; &#8220;What, you want me smash into that other car?&#8221; &#8220;That, or stop at the stop sign.&#8221; I point to the stop sign.  &#8220;Oh, &#8217;cause you can&#8217;t walk around?&#8221; &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have to. You stopped in front of me, when you should have stopped at the stop sign.&#8221; Now in a sarcastic tone, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry to make you walk around. I&#8217;m sorry to hurt your little legs.&#8221; I shake my head, put my headphones back on and continue walking. I can tell the guy is still talking/yelling at me. The last thing I hear, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow. I&#8217;ll be waiting for you.&#8221; Okay, dude. Tomorrow&#8217;s Saturday and I won&#8217;t be here. And at the same time, since my schedule is flexible and I don&#8217;t necessarily walk by here at the same time everyday, I don&#8217;t expect to see you again, even if you do come by every day. As well, it was an off-hand remark and I expected you to keep on driving, like most people would have.

Just settle down.
