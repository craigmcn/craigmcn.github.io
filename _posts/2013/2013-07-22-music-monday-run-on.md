My [800th post](/gods-gonna-cut-you-down-johnny-cash.html "God’s Gonna Cut You Down – Johnny Cash") was the video for Johnny Cash&#8217;s version of _[God&#8217;s Gonna Cut You Down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God's_Gonna_Cut_You_Down)_. I heard Moby&#8217;s version, named _Run On_, the other day and thought I would include the two versions as covers. But when I went looking for information about the cover version, it turned out they were both covers. In fact, because the song is a traditional folk song, there&#8217;s no real original version.

So, this week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is _Run On_. First, a version by [Elvis Presley](http://www.elvis.com/), from his 1967 album, [How Great Thou Art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Great_Thou_Art_(Elvis_Presley_album)). The [Moby](http://www.moby.com/) version is from his 1999 album, [Play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_(Moby_album)).
