I went for drinks yesterday <em style="font-size: 0.8em;">(at the Red Lion, which is now the <a style="font-size: 1em;" href="http://theblakehouse.ca/">Blake House</a>)</em>Â with 2 old/new [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) friends. The reason I slashed old and new is that 1 of the friends is sort of an old friend, while the other is a new friend. The old friend is also kind of a new friend, since we weren&#8217;t really _good_ friends when we knew each other before. The last time I saw the old friend was in grade 4, so definitely kind of a new friend. And her boyfriend, then, is the new friend.

Good people. They like games nights, although they also really like the poker, which really isn&#8217;t up my alley. But we had a nice chat and we&#8217;ll probably end up doing something else some time in the future. Cool.
