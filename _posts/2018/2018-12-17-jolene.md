This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Jolene_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolene_(song)) by
[Dolly Parton](http://www.dollyparton.com/) from a 2016 collaboration with
[Pentatonix](http://ptxofficial.com/home). The [Dumplin’](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4878482/)
version is from the 2018 movie.

I really enjoyed [Dumplin’](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4878482/) and I really love this song. I thought I’d share these two versions with you. I’m sure it’s been discussed _ad nauseum_, but the problem here is neither Dolly nor Jolene, but the man.
