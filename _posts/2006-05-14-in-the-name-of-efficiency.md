There&#8217;s been a bunch of changes around my workplace to increase efficiency, and now another good person has been sacrificed. I believe I&#8217;ve said before, whenever I hear about efficiency in my workplace, someone&#8217;s getting the axe. Someone decided that my former group didn&#8217;t need a Director, but only a Senior manager. So the Director was probably given the choice: less money and lower job level or early retirement. And early retirement wins again!

Also, the Operations Managers are getting their job levels lowered, since their direct reports are 2 job levels lower than them. Hey! Thanks for doing the great job you&#8217;ve been doing for the last 5 years, here&#8217;s less money, less seniority and more responsibility! Oh, thanks! I want to stay with this company forever &#8230; or at least until I&#8217;m back down to entry-level and minimum wage!
