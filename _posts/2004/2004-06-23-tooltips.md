Nothing special going on, just thought I&#8217;d let you know about a feature I added, if you hadn&#8217;t found it already. I added a &#8216;tooltip&#8217; to the Now Playing/Recently Played section, so you can hold your mouse pointer over the item and get the traack information. _To Wublub_: it doesn&#8217;t work too great in Mozilla, but I&#8217;ll see what I can do.

And, hey, thanks, for the input on the pants and the boycotting of the barbecue â€” I feel supported in my decision, although as Gwildor agreed, nobody noticed.
