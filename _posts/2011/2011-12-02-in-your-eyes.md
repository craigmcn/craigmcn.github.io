I don’t know that I’ve ever actually watched the movie all the way through from start to finish, but I’ll always remember one of the best movie quotes:

> I don’t want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don’t want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don’t want to do that.

As a career, I’m glad I don’t do any of those things. But as a regular person in society, I don’t think I can get away from it. And considering Lloyd Dobler has a boombox and a car, I’m sure he has a few sold, bought, or processed items.
