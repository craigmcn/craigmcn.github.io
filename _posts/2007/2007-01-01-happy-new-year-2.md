Oh boy, oh boy, it&#8217;s a new year, with new opportunities! Or, at least, I hope so. Not that [2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006) was terrible, but I guess I always hope the new year will be better than the last.

Many of you will get a more detailed run-down in a personalized, form letter e-mail within the next few days, but here&#8217;s what happened in 2006. I started project intake work with the department I was in. It was interesting and let me learn a lot more detail about what the department does and what the company does. My apartment floor was hacked up and rebuilt. while my mommy was in town visiting. In the summer, I interviewed for 3 jobs and managed to actually get the last one. One of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions for 2006 was to get a new job, so that worked out nicely. I managed some nice vacations to Saskatoon and Calgary. Shuttegirl and RLP got married; good times! I started taking some part-time courses for certification as [Technical Writer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_writer). The first was an HTML course for which I applied for and was granted a Prior Learning Assessment. I was a little disappointed by both the course and the instructor: some of the [salient](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/salient) points of the course were outdated by several years.

That pretty much sums it up. Sorry, I didn&#8217;t get this finished until Tuesday morning, partly because I was debating what to include. There are some other issues that I&#8217;d like to mention, but they&#8217;ll wait for later posts.

**Happy New Year** to everyone and best wishes to you and your families.
