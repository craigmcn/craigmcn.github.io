I read [this article](http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/500-words-before-8am) the other day and I’m intrigued by it’s premise.

> If you begin your day checking the news, checking your email, and checking your notifications, you’ve launched yourself into a day of grazing a mindless consumption.

I’m not completely convinced that’s true, but it merits consideration. When I wake up, I listen to a little news, some music, read through some Twitter updates, and then read some news online. Then I have a shower and eat breakfast. Then I go to work, where I read more online news, tweets, and emails. Consumption.Today, when I got to work, I tried to go straight to my typing exercises and writing this post, but I got a little sidetracked with emails, news, and Facebook. I don’t think it’s unrealistic to be a producer and get your own things done before moving on to consume other people’s stuff, but I think it’ll take a while for me to discard some of those habits.
