A guy gets on a plane and finds himself seated next to a cute blonde.Â He immediately turns to her and makes his move.
  
&#8220;You know,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that flights will go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger. So let&#8217;s talk.&#8221;
  
The blonde, who had just opened her book, closes it slowly and says to the guy, &#8220;What would you like to discuss?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&#8221; says the guy. &#8220;How about nuclear power?&#8221;
  
&#8220;OK,&#8221; says the blonde. &#8220;That could be an interesting topic. But let me ask you a question first. A horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff&#8211;grass. Yet the deer excretes little pellets, the cow turns out a flat patty, and the horse produces muffins of dried poop. Why do you suppose that is?&#8221;
  
The guy is dumbfounded. Finally he replies, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea.&#8221;
  
&#8220;So tell me,&#8221; says the blonde, &#8220;How is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don&#8217;t know shit?
