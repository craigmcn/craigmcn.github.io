Alrighty, everybody, I need your help. I&#8217;ve decided it&#8217;s time to [slowly] start my career as a freelance web developer and technical writer. My focus will be on web-based procedural documentation and communications.

The main web site is going to be a _tips and hints_ blog about [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [MySQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL), and general web design concepts. I plan to write two short pieces and one detailed piece each week. with a weekly podcast encompassing all three pieces. (While I _plan_ to write all this stuff, it may not actually happen right away.)

I will also include the portfolio of stuff I&#8217;ve done so far. My target market is smaller business with smaller budgets who can accept fairly simple, yet entirely functional and usable, site designs. (I&#8217;m very much a simple, two- or three-column. non-[Flash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) designer.)

I need your help with a site name and thus a domain name. I have nothing in mind, so I&#8217;m looking for your suggestions.

**Update (Sep 27):** Ha! I&#8217;m an idiot. I built a fancy AJAX survey thingamajig and forgot to upload the right code to make it actually show up on the rightÂ  pages. Sorry, kids.
