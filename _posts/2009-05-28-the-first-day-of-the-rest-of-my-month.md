Alrighty, Big Cracker is officially no longer unemployed. I&#8217;ve decided that I _am_ in fact self-employed and will spend the next month hard at work finding, and completing, freelance web development and technical writing jobs.

I&#8217;ve been spending my time looking for fulltime work and been highly unsuccessful, so now I&#8217;m taking matters into my own hands. I&#8217;ll be looking at [staff blogging](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2009/05/21/the-other-side-of-problogging-making-real-money-right-from-the-start-of-your-blogging-career/), blogging on my other website, a host of other freelancing websites and job boards, plus writing short stories and working on my novel.

I&#8217;ll be tracking my progress here, on [my other other website](http://craigmcnaughton.ca/), and via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/craigmcn). Somewhere I may be posting ideas and excerpts from my stories and novels, I&#8217;ll let you know.

And, of course, there&#8217;s always [Starbucks](http://starbucks.ca/)! Stop by for a delicious Iced Grande Iced Coffee with Milk, or one of our other [cold comforts](http://www.starbucks.ca/en-ca/_Favorite+Beverages/Cold+Comforts.htm)!
