Okay, I didn&#8217;t think I had anything to say today until I read <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2004/07/20/bagpiper_ottawa040720.html" target="_blank">this story</a> on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news" target="_blank">cbc.ca/news</a> regarding the treatment of a bagpiping busker. As an occasional (okay, seldom, but I&#8217;ve done it) bagpiping busker, I have no argument against the removal of a bagpiper if it is deemed too loud. Yes, bagpipes are a loud instrument. There is no easy way to make them any quieter &#8230; is it possible to intimidate an enemy in battle using a Pan flute? (I mean no offence to Zamfir and other Pan flutists.) I can understand that the Robert Burns Association of North America may have something to say about the negative treatment of a person representing the Scottish culture in Canada, but a boycott of Ottawa? Come on. I&#8217;ve been playing bagpipes for over 2 decades now (and I&#8217;m really not that old) and if the <a href="http://www.byward-market.com/" target="_blank">By-Ward Market</a> Business Improvement Area wants to remove a busker whose music and/or instrument is too loud, I think that&#8217;s their prerogative. The bagpiper in question had even been playing fiddle a few weeks earlier and remained unmolested, which goes to show that the businesses are not against music or buskers in general, only when they are too loud. You&#8217;d maybe think that I&#8217;d stand up for the rights (?) of bagpipers everywhere, but, to me, there&#8217;s a time and a place.
