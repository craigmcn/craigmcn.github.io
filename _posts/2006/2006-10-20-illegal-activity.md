I went down to the ol&#8217; [Canada Computers](http://www.canadacomputers.com/) to get myself a [D-Link MediaLounge](http://www.dlink.com/ca/en/home-solutions/support/product/dsm-320-54mbps-wireless-media-player) and a [Range Extender](http://www.dlink.com/ca/en/home-solutions/connect/access-points-range-extenders-and-bridges). Due the difficulties in getting the MediaLounge, I didn&#8217;t try to find the Range Extender, but I did spend way too much time hanging out in the wireless networking section. The poor guy working the section was trying to explain to some dudes that since they were stealing someone else&#8217;s unsecuredÂ wireless signal, he wasn&#8217;t able to provide with them with a way to boost the signal. What&#8217;s kinda funny is that the Range Extender I was looking for would do exactly that; that&#8217;s why I wanted it. Well, I&#8217;m going to be boosting my own wireless signal, not someone else&#8217;s. But, I mean, man, like the [other dudes in the subway](/blatant-disregard.html), if you&#8217;re doing something that you shouldn&#8217;t be, maybe don&#8217;t go around publicizing it.
