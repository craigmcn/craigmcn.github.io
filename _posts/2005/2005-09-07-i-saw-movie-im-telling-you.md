Holy crap, Batman!! Big Cracker wrote a review for a movie! That only took 9 months!

Yes, it&#8217;s true. There&#8217;s a [review](/river-king.html) for _[The River King](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386751/)_ which is set to be released sometime in the next month or two. I happened to see it &#8217;cause I was in the right place at the right time. I got a free pass when I went to see _[The Brothers Grimm](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/)_ on the weekend. There were a few people handing out something when I walked to the escalators and there was a dude at the top of the escalator, so I went to see what he was flogging (a dead horse was the first thing I thought of).

I love free stuff, but what is it that makes other people complain about them? The people in line behind me wouldn&#8217;t shut up! &#8220;Oh, do we have to wait in line? I don&#8217;t want to wait in line!&#8221; You just saved $30 to come to a movie that nobody else has seen, or will see for another little while, be happy about that! &#8220;Oh, we have to fill in a survey to tell them what we thought, what a pain in the ass!&#8221; Yeah, why else do you think they were giving away free tickets? Just to get more people into theatres this summer? God damn!! &#8220;It better not be a horror movie, I hate horror movies!!&#8221; Why didn&#8217;t you ask what kind of movie it is before taking the free ticket? Or why didn&#8217;t you check it out online before making use of the free ticket? What is wrong with these people?
