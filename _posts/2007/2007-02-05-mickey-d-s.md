I don&#8217;t know how many of you are aware that I&#8217;ve been boycotting [McDonald&#8217;s](http://www.mcdonalds.ca/en/index.aspx) for about 4 years now, but I am. It all started when they discontinued the Western Omelette Bagel on the breakfast menu and replaced it with a McGriddle. I&#8217;ve never had a McGriddle, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s delicious, but I can guarantee that it&#8217;s no replacement for the Western Omelette Bagel. Anywho, it&#8217;s now been around 4 years and the worst I&#8217;ve done is to share in a 2-for-1 McDonald&#8217;s sundae deal. It&#8217;s not a big deal, but admittedly they have the best fries on the fast food market. The problem is that there is a restaurant everywhere: in the Dundas West [subway](http://www.ttc.ca/) station near my house; at the corner of Dundas and Bathurst, where I transfer streetcars on my way to bagpiping; in the mall across from work; and around the corner from work. I&#8217;m being tempted wherever I go!

What I find funny is that my boycott is fairly frivolous. It&#8217;s one simple thing and it&#8217;s gone on for years. I know people who are politically, morally or ethically opposed to the Golden Arches who still stop by every now and then. I mean, man, they have the best fries!
