Alrighty &#8230; well, not much going on, really. I just thought I&#8217;d mention the new stuff in _Shared Stuff_: the _WinAmp playlist_ is under construction, I want to be able to make some of those files available, plus I&#8217;m cleaning up the ID3 tags for them; and I&#8217;ve added a few things to the tribute to my Uncle Jim.

Other than that &#8230; nothing much &#8230; trying to get my colour printer printing yellow, everything&#8217;s in shades of purple and pink. I tried soaking the cartridge overnight in an alcohol/water mix, like was suggested, but nothing changed, so I think it&#8217;s time for a new cartridge (50 bucks!)

Coffee&#8217;s ready, so it&#8217;s time to go &#8230; I&#8217;ll let you know what happens with gwildor&#8217;s [FreakRadio.net](http://www.freakradio.net) broadcast.
