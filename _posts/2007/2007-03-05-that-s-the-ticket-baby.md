Alrighty, boys and girls, I&#8217;ve finally finished the [Rrroll Up the Rim](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/) stats and posted my own. Yeah, I know, 1 in 20 pretty much sucks, but, hey, it was 5 in 82 last year, so I know what I&#8217;m in for.

If you want, you can click &#8220;add stats&#8221; and add your stats. Enter your name, location and the number of rims you want to record, then click &#8220;show&#8221;. Drop-down lists will appear for each rim to record. Then just click &#8220;Submit&#8221;. It&#8217;ll send me an e-mail with the info and I&#8217;ll approve the submission within a few hours.

Once approved, you&#8217;ll see your name with a shiny bar graph and your winning percentage and ratio.

I&#8217;m still working on the SQL to get other stats.
