It is with great sadness that we say &#8216;Good-bye&#8217; to Wublub and Gonch. They will be making the big move to Saskatchewan. Best of Luck to them in their adventures.

Anyway, I had a pretty good weekend &#8230; <span style="font-family: Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">crackerMail v1.0</span> is almost ready for release, just some final touch-ups needed.

Oh, and man, I saw the funniest thing Saturday night &#8230; The Parliamentary Press Gallery Dinner <del>(sorry, that&#8217;s the best link I could find, so far)</del> on <a href="http://www.cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&act=view3&template_id=46&lang=e" target="_blank">CPAC</a>. I have a **huge** admiration for the Governor General, and she was HI-larious. The Dinner is pretty much a roast of everything and everybody in Parliamentary circles and Adrienne Clarkson poked fun at all of them&#8230; Even herself. She came out dressed like a backpacker &#8230; lampooning her own lavish travels around the world. She then had Margaret Atwood join her for their rendition of &#8216;Diamonds are a Girl&#8217;s Best Friend&#8217;. Paul Martin and Jack Layton seemed to be having a pretty good time, even at their own expense. But, boy, that Steven Harper is a sourpuss. He put on a pretty good show when he was at the podium, but when he was the brunt of the joke, he had a pretty tight-lipped smile. And, congrats to Peter McKay (Deputy Leader, Conservative Party of Canada) who showed up in a kilt!

And obviously nobody cares, since nobody mentioned a problem, but I noticed a problem with the CFL stats, Edmonton was all screwed up &#8230; for whatever reason once Edmonton clinched a playoff berth, they became Edm. &#8230; it&#8217;s all fixed now &#8230; well, once the file updates.
