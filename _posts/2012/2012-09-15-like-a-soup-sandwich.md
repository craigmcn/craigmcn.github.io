There&#8217;s a phrase I like to use to illustrate a really messed-up situation: f&#8212;ed up like a soup sandwich. My sister has morphed it into &#8220;like a cream of mushroom sub.&#8221;

Well, last night, after I said it, Wisedad told a story that literally involved a soup sandwich. Apparently, his daughter, Little H, had a bun that she soaked in a chicken noodle soup and had, for whatever reason, set aside for later. Needless to say, the bun was forgotten.

Later, Wisedad&#8217;s sister-in-law, finding a perfectly good bun, chose to sample the delicious morsel. Equally needless to say, hilarity ensued.
