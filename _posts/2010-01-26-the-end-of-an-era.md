Some bad news today: effective February 28, 2010, Externalgateway.com is closing its doors. Sad, I know, but true. Our six-year experiment in website hosting, development, and design has come to an end. The margins on hosting are such that we can’t be competitive and still make it worth our while.

In any case, this site may be up and down over the next day or two and my email may be a little temperamental, but I’ll get everything moved over to a new host and let everything settle down.
