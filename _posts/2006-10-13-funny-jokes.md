I tell ya, I don&#8217;t understand this pervasive joke:

I&#8217;m carrying something, anything, and someone I pass invariably says, &#8220;Oh, is that for me? You shouldn&#8217;t have.&#8221; My standard response is, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;

What is that all about. Why is that funny? And more to my point, why do people think it&#8217;sÂ still funny?
