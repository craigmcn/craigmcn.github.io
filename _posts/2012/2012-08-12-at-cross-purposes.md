Another thing I&#8217;ve realized is that here at the university we seem to be deceiving our students on a couple of levels. We tell them to come to university to get a good job. Once they get here, we tell them it&#8217;s not about the job, but the education and experience. Wait. What?

True, it&#8217;s mostly about the education and experience ([as](/learning-about-myself.html "Learning about Myself") [previously](/a-philosopher-really.html "A Philosopher? Really?") [discussed](/life-learning.html "Life Learning")). For some—professional colleges, for instance—good jobs are often available after graduation, and are only available to professional-college graduates. And there are really interesting jobs for most liberal arts graduates, if they want to look for them.

But a university education is not intended to provide good jobs. It is intended to make students more knowledgeable and more aware of the world around them. Students should come away from a university education with skills in critical thinking, reading, writing (communication), and possibly some discipline-specific knowledge. In short, students should graduate as employable humans.
