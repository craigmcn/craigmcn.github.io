I feel a little bad that I didn&#8217;t actually write a review for [Brick](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109/). I think it was one of the last (if not _the_ last) movies I saw at the Paradise (or maybe the Revue). It was really good. I was impressed with the story, the setting, the acting. Anyway, because of it, I had pretty high hopes for [The Lookout](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427470/).

[Joseph Gordon-Leavitt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687/) plays Chris Pratt, star hockey player from a wealthy family. Chris is driving when his car is in a fatal accident, leaving him with a serious brain injury. His guilt over the accident and his limited ability to engage in a &#8220;normal&#8221; life make him an easy mark for some bank robbers who recruit him as the lookout for a heist. They plan to rob the bank where Chris works as the night janitor.

The star of the movie is really [Jeff Daniels](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001099/) as Chris&#8217; blind roommate, who also serves as his wise mentor. I was completely convinced that he was blind. And in trying to help Chris live a &#8220;normal&#8221; life, he showed that it was mostly a matter of simply believing that the life you were leading was normal.

6 out of 10 saltines. It was really good, but I think I was expecting too much.
