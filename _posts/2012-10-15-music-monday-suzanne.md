This was a tough one. I don&#8217;t know why, but I wanted a [Leonard Cohen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Cohen) cover, and I know my dad doesn&#8217;t care for [_Hallelujah_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)), so I went for another popular song, [_Suzanne_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_(Leonard_Cohen_song)). But then I was stumped by which cover to choose: [Judy Collins](http://www.judycollins.com/index1.php), [Neil Diamond](http://www.neildiamond.com/), [Tori Amos](http://www.toriamos.com/), [Roberta Flack](http://www.robertaflack.com/)?

I went with [Nina Simone](http://www.ninasimone.com/), because it seems like a more fun version than usual. Everybody else does such a depressing version, &#8220;Oh, poor Suzanne&#8217;s such a wierd nutcase, that&#8217;s too bad.&#8221; But Nina Simone&#8217;s more like, &#8220;Hey, yeah, Suzanne&#8217;s kind of a weird nutcase, but that&#8217;s kind of cool.&#8221;
