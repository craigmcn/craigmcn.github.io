I attended the grand opening of [Hudsons new tap house](http://hudsonstaphouse.com/saskatoon/) in Saskatoon yesterday. It’s a nice looking place, with lots of wood and big screen TVs. With two large bars, there’s plenty of room; the service was great, even with a large, loud, opening night crowd; and the [Hudson’s brews](http://hudsonstaphouse.com/drink/hudsons-brewing-co/ "Henry Hudson's Brews") are all very tasty beers.It was a little loud and crowded, but I’ll head back on another night and see if it’s any better.
