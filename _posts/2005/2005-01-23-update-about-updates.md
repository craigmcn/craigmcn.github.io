A little update about some little updates. I&#8217;m not sure how well this will go over, but I&#8217;ve changed the MP3 listing a little bit. I&#8217;ve moved it into it&#8217;s own page, and changed the format. It now lists by Artist, then by Album, you can click on the Album to expand the track listing for the Album. You can then request the track by clicking on the track itself. Let me know if the colours are bad (even if you&#8217;re colour-blind, let me know about the colours!). The changes should make loading the page a little faster.

I&#8217;ve also changed the &#8220;loading&#8221; message. I added an animated gif. I just think it looks prettier.
