Not mine. No, sadly, I still have the same old job &#8230; well, actually, I&#8217;m not certain I know what my job is this week/month/quarter. But they pay me money, I guess that&#8217;s something.

No, I&#8217;m talking about [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and his fancy new [Geek Squad](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/geeksquad.aspx) job that he&#8217;ll start Monday. Congratulations!!

I&#8217;m also talking about Wublub and his fancy job that sends him to [Vancouver](http://www.tourismvancouver.com/) and gives him a fun lunchtime where they won&#8217;t be managed by technology. Good for you!!

So where&#8217;s my fun job? I&#8217;m in charge of some kind of a project or the implementation of a project or troubleshooting the implementation of a project or investigating the troubleshooting of the implementation of a project &#8230;. See, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I thought I signed on to write procedures and communication documents about those procedures. I seriously don&#8217;t have the first, foggiest clue what it is that I do. I had a meeting to discuss my progress: &#8220;How&#8217;s it going?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; &#8220;Where are we at?&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll bring it to the Senior Leadership team and see what they say.&#8221; &#8220;Okay.&#8221; &#8230; [some time later that day] &#8230; &#8220;They think you&#8217;re on the right track. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing.&#8221; &#8220;Okay.&#8221; &#8230; [sits and stares at computer]

I&#8217;m not kidding.
