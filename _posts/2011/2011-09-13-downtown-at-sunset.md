Downtown, at sunset, across the river. This is halfway through my run, facing south-west-ish; the last one was facing north-ish.

These runs are good, and fun, sort of. On the last one, I sort of felt wiped out about halfway through. But on this one, I was only feeling wiped about halfway through each run, and then the walks got me going again.
