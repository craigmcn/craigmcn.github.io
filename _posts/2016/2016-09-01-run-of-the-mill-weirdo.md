Not too long ago, I was chatting with a friend about people's idiosyncrasies and peccadilloes. As she described some of hers, she suggested that I would think she was a weirdo. After hearing about her utter strangeness, I didn&#8217;t think that her things were any weirder than anyone else&#8217;s. I told her that if she was a weirdo, she was just a [run-of-the-mill](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/run-of-the-mill.html) weirdo.

She argued that, surely, if anything, she was an exceptional weirdo. And being a nice fellow, I agreed that she was exceptional. But afterwards, I realized that, no, really, her things are no weirder than anyone else&#8217;s.

As exceptional as individual people are, we&#8217;re still just run-of-the-mill weirdos.
