excerpt: As a Christmas present one year, the Laird gave his gamekeeper, MacPhail, a deerstalker hat with ear-flaps. MacPhail was most appreciative and always wore it with the flaps tied under his chin to keep his ears warm in the winter winds.

MacPhail was most appreciative and always wore it with the flaps tied under his chin to keep his ears warm in the winter winds. One cold, windy day the Laird noticed he was not wearing the hat.
  
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the hat?&#8221; asked the Laird.
  
&#8220;I&#8217;ve given up wearing it since the accident,&#8221; replied MacPhail.
  
&#8220;Accident? I didn&#8217;t know you&#8217;d had an accident.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Yes. A man offered me a nip of whisky. I had the earflaps down and never heard him.&#8221;
