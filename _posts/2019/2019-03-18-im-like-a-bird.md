This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_I’m Like a Bird_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Like_a_Bird) by
[Nelly Furtado](http://nellyfurtado.com/) from her 2000 album,
[Whoa, Nelly!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoa,_Nelly!). The [Tyler Shaw](https://www.tylershawmusic.com/)
version is from a 2019 performance for [CBC’s Junos 365 Sessions](https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos).

I really like these Junos sessions of Canadian artists covering award-winning Canadian songs. They’re great for these posts, but also great examples of Canadian talent.
