Okay, sorry, it&#8217;s been well over a week since I last posted and I have few excuses. Mostly it&#8217;s that every time I think of something to post, I&#8217;m sitting on the bus, in the coffee shop or otherwise not near a computer. It&#8217;s occurred to me, especially when thinking about starting a &#8220;real&#8221; blog, that I should have a small notebook with me to jot down notes. That may actually happen if I finally get around to getting a smart phone of some description. (I have a [Palm m105](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_m100_series) that I don&#8217;t use anymore, because every time I replace the batteries it completely resets.) I have been regularly active on the [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), but mostly just to set my status to song lyrics (e.g., Big Cracker is sending out an S.O.S. &#8230; sending out an S.O.S. &#8230; sending out an S.O.S. &#8230;; Big Cracker is caught between the moon and New York City).

After our experience at Crave, [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/century/) and I went for brews at the [Mill St. brew pub](http://www.millstreetbrewpub.ca/). We had an interesting discussion about how we&#8217;ve got a ton of really great, really smart, really creative friends doing all kinds of great work, but none of us are giant millionaires, captains of industry or world-renowned celebrities. We figured that there must be something that we can do to change that.

Now I&#8217;ve got 2 small-time ideas (neither of which I&#8217;m going to tell you about for fear of them being stolen; no, I don&#8217;t really trust you), but I&#8217;m not sure how to bring them to fruition.
