Although I&#8217;ve only had one instance of spam responses to my blogs, Wublub mentioned a problem on his site. To ensure it doesn&#8217;t happen again, I&#8217;ve implemented a validation code on my blog response page.

I&#8217;m also at work on something that [Veedub](http://projectkr.blogspot.ca/) mentioned. I&#8217;m trying to implement a way to &#8220;watch&#8221; the blogs for responses. When you post a response, you can choose to watch for updates and get an e-mail when new responses are posted or the blog is updated. We&#8217;ll see what happens.
