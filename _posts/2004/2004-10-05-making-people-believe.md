My main reason for being in town is by buddy Nelson/Santo&#8217;s wedding to the lovely and talented E. And the reason I came in a week early was to be able to go to the stag. Now, Saskatoon has a bylaw that works against strip clubs, so there&#8217;s only one, and the poor owner is in court fairly regularly. So, there&#8217;ll be no strippers. Most of us are from out of town and staying at our parents&#8217; houses &#8230; so no wild parties with strippers, or even porn. Starting to sound a little lame? So we had planned to do some go-karting, but it&#8217;s Saskatchewan and generally a little cold out&#8230; so no go-karting. Dinner and drinks, then hopefully some drunken frivolity &#8230; should be good.

I&#8217;m going to add a note about my last post &#8230; I had no intention of making people believe that they didn&#8217;t have anything useful to contribute, and thus should simply keep their &#8216;pie-holes&#8217; shut. But I think you all understood the context. If someone has an idea that you think is inapproriate, ill-considered, or even incorrect, unless you have a reasonable alternative that you can clearly communicate, don&#8217;t bother. I am happy to hear alternatives to anything I have said or have to say. But if your response is to mock me or criticize my ideas, leave me alone. I want to hear your opinion, and I will be able to judge for myself the strength of each of our ideas.

I apply this idea very obviously, and always, to advertising. If a company cannot advertise their product without saying that a specific competitor&#8217;s product is inferior, then I want no part of that product. My prime example is Pepsi™. They always, and I mean always (seriously, find me a time when they don&#8217;t) use Coke™ in their ads &#8230; Showing some dude surrounded by Coke™ products or insignia having some epiphany when trying Pepsi™ and leaving all the Coke™ behind. You don&#8217;t see any Pepsi™ products in Coke™ advertising ever.
