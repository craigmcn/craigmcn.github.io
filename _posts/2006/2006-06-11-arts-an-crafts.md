I managed to catch [Art School Confidential](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364955/) last night at [the Revue](http://revuecinema.ca/) cinema. It&#8217;s a shame that the theatre (and other Festival Cinemas) are closing at the end of the month. Not that I went a lot, but they were good theatres: inexpensive, decent popcorn and sodas and what not; playing second-run movies that I might not have caught on the first run.

Anywho, what a fun movie. It&#8217;s always fun to watch people poke fun at themselves. In this case, artists being pompous and generally taking themselves too seriously. And [Ethan Suplee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0839486/) does a wicked parody of [Kevin Smith](http://www.newsaskew.com/)!
