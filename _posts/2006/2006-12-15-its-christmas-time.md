Well, it looks the code for changing to the Xmas style ran without fail. Notice the green and red borders and Merry Christmas in the menu, as well as the festive Externalgateway.com logo. Gotta love the [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/).

And although you&#8217;ll never see it, I&#8217;ve added a fun &#8220;Save&#8221; option for my custom blogging solution. So now there should be fewer days without posts, since I&#8217;ll be able to start and stop as I please before finally posting. No promises, though!
