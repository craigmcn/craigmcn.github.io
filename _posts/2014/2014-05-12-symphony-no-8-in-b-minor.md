This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Franz Schubert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert)&#8216;s [Symphony No. 8 in B minor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._8_(Schubert)). (You&#8217;ll want to turn up the volume, the music starts very quietly, but gets louder fairly quickly.)

I first heard this piece of music in 1991 when I was on a student exchange to Germany. I attended school there and, in music class, we listened to classical music and discussed the music. I was largely unfamiliar with classical music at the time and this piece really worked for me. I really didn&#8217;t follow most of the discussions (they were about classical music in German), but I got to listen to the piece quite a lot.

I think I like the first movement (Allegro moderato in B minor) the most and picture it as the opening to a murder mystery movie. It seems to like a real &#8220;dark and stormy night&#8221; kind of opening. The rest of the piece is somewhat lighter. I&#8217;m not sure how it fits into my movie, but I&#8217;m sure I can work something out.
