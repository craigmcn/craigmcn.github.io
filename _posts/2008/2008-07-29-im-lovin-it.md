Alrighty, I&#8217;m slightly ashamed, but I&#8217;ll survive. [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) will be happy with my decision to end my boycott of [McDonald&#8217;s](http://www.mcdonalds.ca/en/index.aspx) after 5 long years. It started when Rotten Ronnie&#8217;s abandoned the delicious Western Omelette Bagel for the disgusting McGriddle. I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;ve been sacrificing the delicious fries, cheeseburgers and sundaes because of one lousy breakfast sandwich. I&#8217;ve decided that I will simply boycott the breakfasts ([Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/en/index.html) is decidedly better anyway) and begin enjoying the Mickey D&#8217;s again (in moderation).
