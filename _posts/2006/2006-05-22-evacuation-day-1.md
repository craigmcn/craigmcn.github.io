So, here I am, evacuated. I&#8217;m not sure how many people I told, but my landlord needs to get some dudes in to work on the sewer line. Because I live in the basement, the sewer line is in the floor of my apartment. To work on the sewer line means to open up the floor of my apartment. Not a big deal, but it means that I have dirt and dust all over the place, and holes in my bathroom, laundry room and kitchen.

My landlord was gracious enough to find me a new place just down the road, about 2 and a half blocks. It&#8217;s closer to the [subway](http://www.ttc.ca/) and on the 2nd floor, so I get a nice breeze through the windows.

Also, my landlord hooked me up with chips, candy, beer, juice, water, popcorn, shampoo, conditioner, soap, towels, deodorant &#8230; he even hooked me up withÂ  a razor and shaving cream, and I didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell him that I only shave with a blade once a month.

And the place where I am now hooked me up with wireless internet access, so I&#8217;ll have to see what illegal activity I can get up to!

That&#8217;s it for now! Payce! (oh and Happy Birthday, [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)! he&#8217;s the big 2-9 as of Thursday)
