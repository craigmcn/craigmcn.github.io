This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [LeAnn Rimes](http://www.leannrimesworld.com/#!)&#8216; _Blue_, from her 1996 album, [Blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_(LeAnn_Rimes_album)). A little while ago at a trivia night, the category was Blue Music, with &#8220;blue&#8221; being in the answer, which included both titleÂ and artist of the song that was played. LeAnn Rimes&#8217; Blue was played, and my team&#8217;s answer was [Patsy Cline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patsy_Cline)&#8216;s _I&#8217;m Blue Again_ (or maybe another Cline tune, my teammates can correct me). _Blue_ was written by [Bill Mack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mack) and he avers that he didn&#8217;t write the song for Cline, but hearing Rimes&#8217; version, it certainly could have been. We we&#8217;re pretty confident the singer was Patsy Cline.
