I [made mention](/killing-spiders.html) of being chastised for killing a spider in the office a while back and now I hope I have made the necessary reparations. There&#8217;s been a spider living in my sink for the last few weeks and I&#8217;ve been careful not to kill it outright. I have a double-sink in my kitchen, so I use on for washing and the other for rinsing. Today I needed both, &#8217;cause I&#8217;d made a shitload of dishes preparing lunches for the week, so obviously spidey could no longer live in the sink. I took a nice, soft facial tissue ([Kleenex](http://www.kleenex.com/) to you brand-name slaves) and moved the little tyke from the sink and placed it tidily outside my door. Good luck, spidey!
