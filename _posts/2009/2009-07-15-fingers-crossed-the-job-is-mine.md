Woo hoo! What a super-fantastic job interview yesterday! In fact, what a super-fantastic day yesterday! So far, this week has been pretty good to me.

I had an interview for Project Manager at [Zu.com](http://www.zu.com/) yesterday, and while I was not really pumped for the interview going in, I feel pretty good about it coming out. I was feeling that I didn&#8217;t really have the necessary skills and experience for project management. But hearing from the interviewers, the Zu CEO and one of their project managers, I&#8217;m pretty confident that I have what it will take to be a successful project manager for them. They were interviewing four people out of more than 20 decent applications (having rejected out-of-hand several more applications), and I was one of them. At the same time, I&#8217;ve worked on a bunch of web projects, following solid project management principles and encountering standard challenges from clients and technology. So, I&#8217;m in good shape; I know what&#8217;s going on.

By the way, as I&#8217;ve said before, if any of you know anyone at Zu, put in a good word for me, &#8217;cause you all know how awesome I am. ðŸ˜‰

At the same time, I got things working for the Direct Selling Exhibition website Monday evening. And I got things fixed up for the [Western Cities HR Conference](http://www.westerncitiesconference.ca/) yesterday. Plus, a handful of blog posts done (thetechwriterblog.com, thewebdevelopersblog.com). All in all a good couple of days work.
