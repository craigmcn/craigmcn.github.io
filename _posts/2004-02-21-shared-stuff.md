I&#8217;ve added a _Shared Stuff_ section. I&#8217;ve put the tribute to my Uncle Jim that was read at his memorial service. There is a link to my Gramma&#8217;s poems, but they&#8217;re not ready yet. I&#8217;ve got pictures of Uncle Jim, his obituary and his funeral program to upload still. I hope to add all kinds of stuff to the _Shared Stuff_, so people will see what I&#8217;m all about.

Okay, I got Gramma&#8217;s poems up now, it took a lot of work to convert the Word document to a HTML document (without just saving the document as Web page, &#8217;cause, man, that doesn&#8217;t work well) &#8230; I wrote an Excel macro (&#8217;cause I&#8217;m the king of the Excel macro) to writeÂ a text file and input the HTML code with the document text.

Enjoy!
