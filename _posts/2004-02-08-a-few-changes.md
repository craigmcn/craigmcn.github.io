Okay, so I&#8217;ve changed up the site a bit. I&#8217;ve moved the original Blog post to a section called Editorials. This section will contain the &#8220;Man, you won&#8217;t believe this &#8230;!&#8221; posts, with responses like &#8220;Dude, **I** know! Like this one time (at band camp) &#8230;!&#8221;

You can post responses to either. I plan to maintain both.

Okey Dokey, let me post something now &#8230; My buddy gwildor, his girlfriend trikie and I play a game called [Settlers of Catan](http://www.catan.com/). In fact, we played a game last night, and as usual gwildor kicked ass. It a cool game with a board that is built using specific tiles, but in a random order&#8230; so the game&#8217;s a little different every time. Each tile is for a resource, you collect resources to build roads, settlements and cities. So gwildor was online looking for some [info on the game](http://www.universityofcatan.com/) and found a dude who had done some crazy work on the 2-dimensional, paper tiles &#8230; now that&#8217;s is a guy with too much time on his hands!

That&#8217;s it, see ya later &#8230;
