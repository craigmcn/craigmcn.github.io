So it took some time, but I&#8217;ve put together a new design for my website. The big problem I had was converting the underlying PHP, because I changed the way the pages are built. This also meant going back through the site and making sure all the pages were converted. I even cleaned up the Administration interface, that you guys don&#8217;t get to see. The pages with a text/HTML editor seem to load a little bit slowly, and the home page hangs a bit on the [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/craigmcn), but I can live with it.
