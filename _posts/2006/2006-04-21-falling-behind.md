Alright, so [downloading TV](http://thepiratebay.se/) is a lot of fun and means I get a lot of [wicked shows](http://www.regenesistv.com/) without commercials that I can watch any time I like, but it means being a day or two behind and fighting with network schedules to find out whether a new show actually aired. So lately, I just search every now and again for the shows that I think should have aired within the last few days and see what I get. But then when I see the shows, everything new about them is already old. &#8220;Hey, Big Cracker, did you see last night&#8217;s [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/)?&#8221; &#8220;No, but it&#8217;s downloading right now!&#8221; &#8220;Hey, Big Cracker, that [Earl](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/) is friggin&#8217; HI-larious!&#8221; &#8220;Ummm, yeah, well, I haven&#8217;t found the [torrent](http://www.bittorrent.com/) yet.&#8221;

So, anyway, I finally managed to track down and watch this week&#8217;s [CSI:NY](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi_ny/) with a cool ending resulting in finding some incredible website. Of course, being the web-geek that I am, I have to do a [Google](http://www.google.ca/) search for the site, www.aresanob.com. What do I find, first that [nobody thought it all that cool](http://itsamonkey.blogspot.com/2006/04/aresanob.html), but that it&#8217;s just a commercial. [Pbththth!](http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A284528) Although I kinda like [Kid Rock](http://www.kidrock.com/).
