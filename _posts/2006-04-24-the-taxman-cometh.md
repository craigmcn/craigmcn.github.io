Well, it&#8217;s coming on up on the [tax deadline](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/ll-dts/frms-eng.html), and I finally got my [taxes submitted](http://www.netfile.gc.ca/menu-eng.html) this morning. I found out that I make ridiculous amounts of money, and yet somehow I don&#8217;t have any left over. However, I contribute nicely to my [RRSP](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/ndvdls/tpcs/rrsp-reer/menu-eng.html), so there&#8217;s some deductions and savings there.

I used [QuicktaxWeb](http://www.quicktaxweb.ca/) and submitted online. Man! What a time saver. I remember filling out all the forms and making sure I had all the Schedules and my receipts and everything and doing it in pencil and then doing another one in pen and having the calculator. This was so much more comfortable.
