Someone asked me how I was doing, and I said, &#8220;Not too bad.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; was the response.

Really? Good? I&#8217;m just not _too bad_. Obviously, &#8220;not too bad&#8221; translates to &#8220;somewhat good&#8221;. By the same token, does &#8220;not bad&#8221; translate to &#8220;good&#8221;? This sounds like [newspeak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak) to me.

Anywho, in saying &#8220;not too bad&#8221;, I meant that I was fine, so the response was entirely appropriate. I just thought it was kind of wierd.
