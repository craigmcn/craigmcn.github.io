This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Heroes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_song)) by [David Bowie](http://davidbowie.com/) from his 1977 album, [Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Heroes%22_(David_Bowie_album)). [The Wallflowers](http://thewallflowers.com/) version is from the 1998 [Godzilla soundtrack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla:_The_Album).

I watched the movie [Horns](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1528071/), with Daniel Radcliffe, on Netflix a little while ago and liked it. The David Bowie version of *Heroes* was featured more than once in the movie.
