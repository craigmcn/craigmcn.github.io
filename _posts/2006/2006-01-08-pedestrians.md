Today&#8217;s word, boys and girls, is &#8220;pedestrian&#8221;. Can you say &#8220;pedestrian&#8221;?

**pe·des·tri·an** _n._ A person traveling on foot; a walker. [From Latin _pedester_, _pedestr-_: going on foot] (thank you, [dictionary.com](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=pedestrian))

The reason I bring this word to your attention is that I am often a pedestrian myself and it seems that many drivers are unfamiliar with the concept. Twice today my relaxing walking in the megalopolis of [Toronto the Good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Toronto#Nicknames) was completely, fucking hijacked by some fucking moron who had no concept of people trying to cross a fucking street and the goddam white lines on the street indicating a fucking crosswalk.

- <span style="font-weight: bold;">DON&#8217;T</span> park your fucking taxi in my goddam crosswalk, fuckhead!
- <span style="font-weight: bold;">DON&#8217;T</span> think you can turn right, you fucking shithead, I get to cross first, you goddam ignoramus!

Is it me? Really? I doubt it. What the fuck is wrong with people? Fuck!

<span style="font-size: 0.9em;">\* I apologize for my language &#8230; I&#8217;m fucking pissed right off!!</span>
