I&#8217;ve been going through a rough patch these last few weeks and started seeing a counsellor to talk about my issues and establish some strategies for dealing with them.

One of my biggest issues was self-doubt, and mixed with that was my insatiable desire to think about all the terrible things that had happened and were going to happen. It took some counselling to realize that a big part of the solution was determining what was actually happening, not just what I was thinking. I spoke with a couple of people who had some answers about things I was doubting and, boom, doubts gone.

The things I was doubting were not about me, but about situations or other people, over which I have little to no control. There was no reason to dwell on problems that weren&#8217;t mine.

My other big issue was dealing with loss. I felt that my sadness had gone on much too long and was much heavier than I thought appropriate and normal. I&#8217;d read through some information about the five stages of grief and loss (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance) and felt that I&#8217;d gone through a good chunk of them and was really just waiting for the acceptance. I&#8217;m still waiting.

And, apparently, that&#8217;s okay. It&#8217;s more a sign of what the loss means to me than how badly I&#8217;m handling it. I&#8217;m handling it by being sad and I&#8217;m alright with that.

I was recently told that I hadn&#8217;t really been myself lately and that&#8217;s probably true. But at the same time, this is me. This is me being sad for more than a few days. This is me feeling a loss that is maybe less resolved than the loss of a grandparent, aunt or uncle, someone who&#8217;s loss can be understood. But in this case, the loss is something that feels like it can be undone, which it can&#8217;t, or at least not easily, so it lingers.

So my advice to you is that when you&#8217;re sad, upset, frustrated, confused, doubting yourself, whatever&#8217;s making you feel uncomfortable, talk to your friends or your family, or find a professional. This is something we all go through and we can help each other.
