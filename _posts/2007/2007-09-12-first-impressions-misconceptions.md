So there was this woman on the subway yesterday with a black eye.Â My first thought was that she&#8217;s in an abusive relationship. But the more I thought about it, I realized that it could be entirely innocent. Maybe she walked into a door, maybe she has kids and was playing around and got a small fist or elbow in the eye, maybe she plays sports and was hit by a ball or another player. It could be nothing. But I&#8217;m a little concerned that my first thought was to abuse.
