Alright, I&#8217;ve been sitting on this for almost a week, and now there&#8217;s only a week left, so I figured I&#8217;d better say something. [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/) is running a survey (I guess, that&#8217;s what you could call it) to establish [a wish list](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhZJgZfsGW8) for Canadians. They&#8217;re running it in conjunction with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) as a group called _The Great Canadian Wish List_. Right now, the top 2 wishes are: _Abolish Abortion in Canada_ (7148 votes) and _I wish that Canada would remain pro-choice_ (6333 votes).

I think it&#8217;s an interesting experiment and I think it&#8217;s worth exploring. I&#8217;m a little concerned, though, that it really only serves to exemplify that people who support questionable and/or exclusionary ideas tend to be loudest in supporting them. At the same time, people who support inclusive, socially considerate ideas tend to believe them to be self-evident and not needing support. At least, that&#8217;s my opinion.
