This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Landslide_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)) by
[Fleetwood Mac](http://fleetwoodmac.com/) from their self-titled 1975 album,
[Fleetwood Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac_(1975_album)). The [Smashing Pumpkins](http://smashingpumpkins.com/)
version is from their 1994 compilation album, [Pisces Iscariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisces_Iscariot).

We sang-along this song in online choir last week, and joked about the Fleetwood Mac, Stevie Nicks, Dixie Chicks and Smashing Pumpkins versions.
