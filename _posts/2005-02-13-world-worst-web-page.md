When I created crackerMail v1.0 and posted it on <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/?RID=N269918" target="_blank">HotScripts.com</a>, I felt it a good idea to subscribe to their newsletter. I would like to spend more time developing web applications, so I thought this would give me some ideas, as well as tips and pointers. This month&#8217;s newsletter had the winnerÂ of the &#8216;Design The World&#8217;s Worst Web Page&#8217; contest. I don&#8217;t believe there are words in the English language to describe this page. If any of you decide that you need a website, I&#8217;d suggest consulting a few of these resources, before ending up like the winner:

  * <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/tutorials/" target="_blank">Webmonkey</a>
  * [W3Schools Web Site Design](http://www.w3schools.com/web/web_design.asp)
  * <del>Design Basics by Jim Frew (2 Jul 1997)</del>
  * <del>Web Development Primer by Ahmad Permessur (27 Nov 2003)</del>
  * <del>Your First Step into Web Development by Mudassar Saeed Khan (29 Jan 2004)</del>

There&#8217;s [a ton](http://www.google.ca/search?q=web+design+basics&hl=en&lr=&start=10&sa=N) of other sites that discuss design, please look before you leap!
