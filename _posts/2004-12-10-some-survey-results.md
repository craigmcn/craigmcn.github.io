I have some survey results and I&#8217;m disappointed by the &#8216;voter turnout&#8217;. Current results:
  
movies &#8211; 4
  
news &#8211; 1
  
other (&#8217;10 Steps to have Fun @ work&#8217;) &#8211; 1
  
As you might expect, I&#8217;ve already worked out the movies. In fact, that script is already running like a charm on the development server. I&#8217;ll be uploading it Sunday, unless there&#8217;s significant response against it. I can imagine <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> will be voting for the movies a few more times to ensure victory! I have some of the news worked out, I had started on it awhile ago, but went with the CFL for the summer once the Stanley Cup finals were over. We&#8217;ll see about that. I&#8217;m not sure where to go for &#8217;10 Steps to have Fun @ work&#8217;, but I&#8217;ll check it out. I&#8217;d love to hook everybody up with what they want to see.
