I’m hoping that this headline gets a little attention, because I’m posting this as a favour. I think this probably applies most to folks in Toronto, but given their international reputation, it may apply everywhere.

My friends over at [PPF House](http://www.ppfhouse.com) are looking for a good condition, not on its death bed, tour-sized van for sale or rent. If you know of anything, [let me know](mailto:craig@craigmcn.ca) and I’ll get them in touch with you.

Thanks, kids.
