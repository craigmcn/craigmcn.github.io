This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_I Love Rock ’n’ Roll_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Rock_%27n%27_Roll) by
[The Arrows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrows_(British_band)) from their 1975 single. The [Joan Jett & the Blackhearts](http://joanjett.com/)
version is from their 1981 album, [I Love Rock ’n Roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Rock_%27n_Roll_(album)).

Until starting on this post, I thought it was Joan Jett’s song and I was going to pair it with [Britney Spears’ version](https://youtu.be/ITuOddPeYoc). I was even thinking of making it a series like I’ve done in the past, but decided against it. Although, Britney’s version is fine, once in a while is enough.
