This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [Melanie C](http://melaniec.net/). [_2 Become 1_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Become_1), from the [Spice Girls’](https://www.thespicegirls.com/) 1996 debut album, [Spice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_(album)), and [_Goin’ Down_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goin%27_Down_(Melanie_C_song)) from her 1999 album, [Northern Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Star_(Melanie_C_album)).

Sorry, folks, you might get a little tired of Spice Girls over the next few weeks. For some weird nostalgic reason, I’ll be featuring one Spice Girls song and one Spice Girl’s solo song. There are five Spice Girls.
