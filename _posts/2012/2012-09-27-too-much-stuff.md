I&#8217;ve been working on this post for a while, because I&#8217;m trying not to offend anyone. I have way too much stuff myself, so I&#8217;m not immune to my own criticism.

That being said, I&#8217;m having a bit of a challenge with too much stuff. A little more than a week ago, I helped J pack up the boating and summer stuff at his [extended] family&#8217;s cabin and was amazed at all the stuff. Not only is there a cabin full of stuff, there&#8217;s a small bunkhouse of stuff, a small shed of stuff, and a garage of stuff. The garage has lots of stuff, including some fishing poles that J didn&#8217;t even know about. And a flag pole that apparently got lost at one point but never even left the garage. The [Ford Flex](http://www.ford.ca/app/en/fo/year/2013/vehicle/flex.html) barely fit in the two-car garage for all the stuff. I&#8217;m not judging, it&#8217;s just the example that made me think to write about this.

I already have a basement of stuff, a garage of stuff and a shed of stuff. And much of it never gets used. Much of it is just waiting for me to decide that it&#8217;s actually garbage.

The more I think about all of it, the more I think of one more thing I need. Often enough, it&#8217;s the right thing that will let me get rid of all the other wrong things, but then I need to get rid of the wrong things and that too often means the garbage. And sometimes, it&#8217;s one more thing that I think will help me organize all the things, but becomes just one more thing.

I leave you with this bit from George Carlin [talking about stuff](http://youtu.be/MvgN5gCuLac).
