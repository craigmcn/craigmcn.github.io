I&#8217;m not quite sure what &#8216;Tippers Frrrrom Da Chipper!!&#8217; are, nor do I think I would be very popular if I published ways to key your bosses car. Although, I think 10 ways to pass gas and blame someone else would come in useful for a lot of people.

Anyway, as you can see, the movies are already posted. These are weekend results for the past weekend. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/" target="_blank">National Treasure</a> starring the wonderful Nic Cage has topped the list for Dec 3-5, well done. However, guaranteed, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0349903/" target="_blank">Ocean&#8217;s Twelve</a> will make the number 1 spot come tomorrow. I&#8217;ll have a review for you tomorrow, as well, since I&#8217;m headed to see it tonight.

**Update:** the review is available [here](/oceans-twelve.html).
