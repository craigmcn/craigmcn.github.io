I&#8217;m sure by now you&#8217;ve all heard about [the fire this past Wednesday at Queen St. W. and Bathurst St.](https://www.google.ca/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&q=toronto+fire+bathurst&btnG=Google+Search&meta=#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=toronto+fire+bathurst+queen+2008&oq=toronto+fire+bathurst+queen+2008&gs_l=serp.3...16582.21225.0.21645.11.11.0.0.0.0.193.1723.0j11.11.0...0.0...1c.FAhT2m-qL8g&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&fp=fbd6dacde2188f11&biw=1280&bih=699) Well, Big Cracker has some small personal connection to the situation.

The first emergency call was from 615 Queen St. W., the location of National Sound, a small, used electronics shop. As far as I could tell from the articles I read, there&#8217;s no clear indication that the fire started there, but that was the location of the first emergency call. At the back of National Sound is a small studio space that I rented for my bagpiping. I was there last Sunday and was planning to be in this morning. When I went down this morning, the street was blocked off by police and there were fire and disaster recovery vehicles all over the street.

[The Toronto Star](http://thestar.com/) has a good [PDF describing the aftermath of the fire](http://www3.thestar.com/static/PDF/080221_queen_blaze.pdf).
