Sorry, folks, I didn&#8217;t realize it had been so long since I had last posted. I&#8217;ve been busy working on content for another blog site, learning the ropes of becoming a freelance writer, looking at writing a novel and some short stories, working on the back-end of [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/), consulting on website templates (unfortunately for free) and generally looking for work.

But in the course of my travels I ran across an interesting organization, the [Fabian Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Society), who believe in gradual societal change to socialism (as opposed to [Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx) who favoured revolution by the lower classes). As a self-professed moderate socialist, I don&#8217;t completely agree with all of their ideas, but I certainly like the motto I heard attributed to them: “What do we want?” “Gradual change!” “When do we want it?” “In due course!”
