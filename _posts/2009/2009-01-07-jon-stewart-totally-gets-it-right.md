I haven&#8217;t a whole lot to say lately, but yesterday I managed to catch the beginning of Monday&#8217;s Daily Show with Jon Stewart (<del>you might have to watch the ad; the section I&#8217;m talking about is at ~6:35</del>). This [whole Israel-Gaza thing](http://news.google.ca/news?q=israel+gaza+palestinian+assault&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&um=1&hl=en&sa=X&oi=news_group&resnum=1&ct=title) drives me up the f&#8212;in&#8217; wall, but Jon Stewart knows where it&#8217;s at! &#8220;I guess it depends if I forced that guy to live in my hallway!&#8221;

**Update 2012-08-02:** Not surprisingly, the video is no longer available. Sorry.
