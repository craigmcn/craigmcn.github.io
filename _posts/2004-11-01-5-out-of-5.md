crackerMail received 5 g&#8217;s out of 5 from <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>. I definitely didn&#8217;t expect anything that good. Thanks, buddy.

I&#8217;m (we&#8217;re) making some great headway on Externalgateway.com. I&#8217;ve created a Domain Name search function, well I stole it from someone else and used it. It&#8217;s good, but not great, I&#8217;ll get there. Plus <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>&#8216;s putting together the Admin functionality, it&#8217;s very pretty.

And a quick note about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Canadian" target="_blank">CBC&#8217;s Greatest Canadian</a> poll. Because I&#8217;m in love with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Auf_der_Maur#The_Greatest_Canadian_Advocate" target="_blank">Melissa Auf der Maur</a>, I&#8217;ll have to back her candidate, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Suzuki#Awards_and_honours" target="_blank">David Suzuki</a>. But I&#8217;m really behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stroumboulopoulos#The_Greatest_Canadian" target="_blank">George Strombopolopolous</a>&#8216; candidate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Douglas#Late_career_and_retirement" target="_blank">Tommy C. Douglas</a>.

And hoo boy! I just got off an hour-long conversation with my buddy DM from Banff. Poor DM worked with me when I was out there and he quit or was asked to leave or something about a year ago. He was working at a grocery store in Canmore this whole time and has decided to start looking for work again. This whole time we&#8217;ve not really been in touch, so it was nice catching up with him.

**Update (Nov. 2) &#8230;** Sorry for all these updates, but mostly they don&#8217;t require new blogs. crackerMail v1.0 has now been made available in a final release with 5 bug fixes. Thanks to <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> for pointing out most of them. If anyone downloaded the .zip file before 11:30pm (Nov. 2), delete your files, delete the folder, re-create the folder and extract the new files&#8230; This includes you, Gw. I&#8217;m really sorry.
