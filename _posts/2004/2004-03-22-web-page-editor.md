I have this shiny website. I spend a lot of time and effort with the fancy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad_(software)" target="_blank">Notepad</a> to create it. I&#8217;m comfortable with Notepad. In fact, gwildor even mentioned once that he&#8217;d seen a website with a &#8220;created in Notepad&#8221; note on it (check out <a href="http://www.notepad.org" target="_blank">Notepad.org</a>). I use <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com" target="_blank">MySQL</a>, and javascript in my site, and all of it edited in Notepad. I have <a href="http://www.emeditor.com" target="_blank">EmEditor</a>, which is nice when tracking down problems, &#8217;cause it&#8217;s all colour-coded and what-not, but I like Notepad better.

My main point is really about not using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/word/prodinfo/default.mspx" target="_blank">MS-Word</a> as your web page editor. I frown on taking a document that is intended for printing on paper and making a web page&#8230;. The Internet is on computers! If you&#8217;re going to use an HTML or web page editor, use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/frontpage/prodinfo/default.mspx" target="_blank">MS-FrontPage</a>, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/?promoid=home_prod_dw_082403" target="_blank">Dreamweaver</a>, or <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/golive/main.html" target="_blank">Adobe GoLive</a>, but not MS-Word. Granted Microsoft makes some shiny software and it can be used to build web pages. Don&#8217;t. There&#8217;s a thing called the Internet &#8230; wait, isn&#8217;t that what we&#8217;re talking about &#8230; yes, the Internet, jam-packed full of information: 95% porn, 1% personal websites (with dubious content), 2% legitimate information, and the final 2% websites about making websites. (I made up those stats, it&#8217;s probably closer to 97% porn.) So, in that 2%, there should be somthing for you to help you make a good website &#8230; and you can probably use Notepad.
