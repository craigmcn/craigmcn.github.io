excerpt: I certainly hope the NDP will push for some electoral reform, in the way of proportional representation. I mean, they got 17.5% of the popular vote and 29 seats, where the Bloc only got 10.5% of the popular vote and a whopping 51 seats.

  | Cons. | Lib. | B.Q. | N.D.P. | Other | Total
-- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Leading: | 124 | 103 | 51 | 29 | 1 | 308
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Popular vote (%): | 36.3 | 30.2 | 10.5 | 17.5 | 5.6 | 100

As you can see from the chart above, there was no majority winner. Not really even a minority with a party holding the &#8220;balance of power&#8221;. Technically, the BQ and the Conservatives represent a strong majority, but there&#8217;s no guarantee that the Bloc will always support the Tories. The NDP gained some ground—locally, in my riding and in Trinity-Spadina, the Liberal incumbent was defeated—but nothing really decisive. I figure we&#8217;re looking at another 18 months of screwing around with policies that the country really doesn&#8217;t want, but with a government that at least isn&#8217;t the last one.

I certainly hope the NDP will push for some electoral reform, in the way of [proportional representation](http://www.fairvote.ca/). I mean, they got 17.5% of the popular vote and 29 seats, where the Bloc only got 10.5% of the popular vote and a whopping 51 seats. It&#8217;s a little lop-sided, if you ask me.

Unfortunately, no [Green Party](http://www.greenparty.ca/) candidates managed to win, but maybe they&#8217;ll get even more money and mount a more impressive campaign next time. And it seems interesting that in the highly contested region of Québec, an independent was elected.
