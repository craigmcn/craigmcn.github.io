Shmicken sal! Scarbloosh! Aaah &#8230; the gibberish of yesteryear. I don&#8217;t remember where they came from but those two &#8230; uhhh &#8230; phrases(?) were used commonly in high school and university, respectively. My buddy, Cal, used to use &#8220;luftwaffe&#8221; regularly, as well. I didn&#8217;t quite get into that one. What does this have to with anything? Nothing. I&#8217;m just saying.

The long weekend was spent in darkness and quiet as I nursed a migraine Saturday and Sunday.

In other news, [Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and I went to see [Superman Returns](http://supermanreturns.warnerbros.com/) on the weekend. Really good. Although, I wasn&#8217;t impressed by [Kate Bosworth](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0098378/) as [Lois Lane](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Lane). Every time she was on-screen I was expecting someone else, or thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s not Lois Lane.&#8221; Otherwise, I thought it was a good movie.

I was expecting a re-telling of the [Superman story](http://www.dccomics.com/superman), but since this one starts where the [Christopher Reeve](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001659/) story ends, there wasn&#8217;t any special character development or any introduction, we jumped right into the story.

[Kevin Spacey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000228/) did a good job as [Lex Luthor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Luthor) (I was a little skeptical going in), and [Frank Langella](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001449/) did a good job as [Perry White](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_White) (although Big Gwilly was strongly reminded of [Skeletor](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093507/)). [Brandon Routh](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0746125/) looked just like Christopher Reeve when he was [Clark Kent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Kent); it made the story that much more continuous.

**8 saltines out of 10** &#8230; I was distracted by Kate Bosworth not believable as Lois Lane.
