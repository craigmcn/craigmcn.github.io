This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Army of Me_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Me_(Bj%C3%B6rk_song)) by [Björk](http://bjork.com/) from her 1995 album, [Post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_%28Bj%C3%B6rk_album%29). The [Worst Pop Band Ever](http://wpbe.ppfhouse.com) (WPBE) [version](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com/track/army-of-me) was recorded in 2006. I added the WPBE version to my playlist of their 2006 album, [Thanks for Coming Out](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com/album/thanks-for-coming-out), which I&#8217;ve been listening to quite regularly at work.
