Some of you may know my boycott of [McDonald&#8217;s](http://www.mcdonalds.ca/en/food/index.aspx) for discontinuing one of their breakfast sandwiches—ongoing now for about 4 years. Well, I almost ended up boycotting [Zellers](http://www.hbc.com/zellers/) yesterday.

Saturday, I bought a shirt—a nice [Stanfield&#8217;s](http://www.stanfields.com/men/underwear/shirts.html) waffle-pattern, long-sleeved, thermal undershirt. The package had an &#8220;L/G&#8221; sticker on it. I own a large Stanfield&#8217;s waffle-pattern, long-sleeved, thermal undershirt, so I didn&#8217;t feel the need to try this one on, or to examine it any more closely. When I got home and took it out of the package, the tag showed &#8220;XL/TG&#8221;. Not usually a big deal, but the Zellers location is closing and &#8220;all sales final&#8221; signs are posted all over the store.

I went back to the store to see if I could at least exchange the shirt. But since the store is closing, the stock is pretty well picked over. I found another shirt with an &#8220;L/G&#8221; sticker and with a little squashing I found it also had an &#8220;XL/TG&#8221; tag. So I went to Customer Service to see what else I could do.

&#8220;All sales final,&#8221; the snippy, young clerk told me.
  
&#8220;I bought a large, and the package shows I bought a large, but the shirt is extra-large. How can I be responsible for what&#8217;s in the package?&#8221;
  
&#8220;You should have opened it and checked.&#8221;
  
&#8220;So I can open any package in the store to make sure it contains what I want? DVD players, potato chips?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Well, no.&#8221;
  
&#8220;So how was I supposed to know that what I was buying was not what I wanted?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Fine. I can give you a gift card for the purchase price.&#8221;

Man, why didn&#8217;t you just do it in the first place?
