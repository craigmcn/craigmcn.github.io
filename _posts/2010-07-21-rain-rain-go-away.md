I don&#8217;t know about the rest of you, but this rain&#8217;s starting to get me down. üôÅ If it&#8217;s going to rain all summer, fine, I&#8217;ll accept it. I&#8217;ll buy myself a better [raincoat](http://www.mec.ca/Products/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524442629023&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302699139&bmUID=1279724590109) and a bus pass, and I&#8217;ll suck it up. But when the forecast everyday calls for rain and then it doesn&#8217;t rain, it really pisses me off.

I need to water my lawn, but it&#8217;s going to rain, so I don&#8217;t. I want to ride my bike to work, but¬†it&#8217;s going to rain, so I don&#8217;t. And then it doesn&#8217;t rain, but it still might, so what then? Do I water my lawn? Do I ride my bike? Grr.

I hope the rotten weather is treating you better than it&#8217;s treating me.
