One more time and I promise not to whinge about people&#8217;s idiotic behaviour.

<ol class="blog">
  <li class="blog">
    When exiting an elevator, walking through a doorway or disembarking an escalator, continue to walk for several steps to ensure the people behind you are also able to exit, walk or disembark.
  </li>
  <li class="blog">
    When on a bus, streetcar or subway train, either sit down or move as far from the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ingress">ingress</a>Â as humanly possible. <ul class="blog">
      <li class="blog">
        <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corollary">Corollary</a>: Unless you know that you&#8217;re exiting the vehicle within the next 2 stops (on a subway train) or 4 stops (on a bus or streetcar), <strong>do not</strong> stand in front of the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/egress">egress</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li class="blog">
    When using an escalator, stand on the right and walk on the left. <ul class="blog">
      <li class="blog">
        I know this is not common knowledge, but it is common sense: faster vehicles pass slower vehicles on the left and slower vehicles should stay to the right.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

I&#8217;m sure I have more helpful hints, and I will update this post as they come up, but otherwise I will refrain from mentioning people&#8217;s idiotic behaviour any more.
