Since it&#8217;s [all over the friggin&#8217; news](http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&q=shia+flutter), I want to congratulate my buddy, [h!](http://www.ppfhouse.com/flutter), for taking the top prize in the Open Entries section of the Tokyo International Anime Fair. I have the DVD, if you want to borrow it, but I would suggest you visit [the website](http://ppfhouse.com/flutter/order.php) <del>(PPF site >Â Order)</del> and just buy a copy (it&#8217;s money well spent).
