Finally 2 months later, I got my first non-Roll Up cup for my medium coffee. While I&#8217;m disappointed with the overall results, and was highly frustrated by the dearth of winners in my 87 cups, I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised that the combined stats of 10 people came pretty close to the published odds. My own experience (in the last 2 cups) shows the bigger cups have more prizes. I&#8217;ll adjust the stats display to confirm odds of cup size vs. winners.
