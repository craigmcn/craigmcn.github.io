Hey, boys and girls, I&#8217;m working on a project and need some input.

If you were looking to buy a new car, and were doing your research online, would you go directly to the dealer&#8217;s website, or would you start at the manufacturer&#8217;s website?

If you were looking for a used car, would you go to a dealer website, or to something like [Auto Trader](http://www.canadatrader.com/)?

One other thing, is it possible to be a loyal car dealership customer?
