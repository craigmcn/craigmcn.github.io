So, here we are in 2006 &#8230;. I&#8217;m in a new apartment that I&#8217;m still in the process of moving into (maybe one of my New Year&#8217;s resolutions should be to get my stuff out storage), I have a job that pretty much sucks, but it pays well, and I spent last night drinking and having a generally good time with good ol&#8217; [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/) and Big A.

This year&#8217;s resolutions (seriously) are to find a new job and lose some weight. Along the way, I won&#8217;t be disappointed if I manage to get some part-time work as a bartender, get some other part-time work building websites (I mean, check out [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/), fabulous and all mine! well, thanks to [h!](http://www.ppfhouse.com/century.php) for the artwork.) and get some time to build some cool [javascript](http://www.javascript.com/) and [PHP](http://www.php.net/) scripts for other people to use.

In other news, today is my Mommy&#8217;s birthday &#8230; I know there are other days during the year that are other people&#8217;s birthdays, but today is a special day generally, and happens to be also my Mommy&#8217;s birthday. It&#8217;s also one of my colleagues birthday, so come Tuesday, when I&#8217;m back at work, there&#8217;ll be treats for everyone! (Yeah, we have to bring treats to work on our birthday &#8230; nobody brings <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span> treats because it&#8217;s <span style="font-style: italic;">our</span> birthday.)
