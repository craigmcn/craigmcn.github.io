In church I heard a lady in the pew next to me saying a prayer. It was so sweet and sincere that I just had to share with you:

> Dear Lord, This has been a tough two or three years â€¦
>
> You have taken my favourite actor Patrick Swayze.
>
> My favourite musician Michael Jackson.
>
> My favourite salesman Billy Mays.
>
> My favourite actress Elizabeth Taylor.
>
> And now my favourite singer Whitney Houston.
>
> I just wanted you to know that my favourite politician is Stephen Harper.
