This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Spiderwebs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiderwebs_(song)) by
[No Doubt](http://nodoubt.com/) from their 1995 album,
[Tragic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_Kingdom). The [Trevor Bragg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCklo2D-YdxppQwR7LxLo4ww)
version is from a 2020 performance.

I love the added vocals and video Trevor put in for this. Great work!
