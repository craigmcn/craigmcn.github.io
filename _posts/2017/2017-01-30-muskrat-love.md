This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Muskrat Love_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muskrat_Love) by [Willis Alan Ramsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Alan_Ramsey) and performed by [America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_(band)) for their 1973 album, [Hat Trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_Trick_(album)). The [Captain & Tennille](http://captainandtennille.net/) version is from their 1976 album, [Song of Joy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Joy_(album)).

[David Sedaris](http://www.davidsedarisbooks.com/naked.html) mentions this song in the title story of his book *Naked*. I'm pretty sure I'd never heard it before, and now that I have, What the f---?
