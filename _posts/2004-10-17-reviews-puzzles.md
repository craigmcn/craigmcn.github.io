Another post, the next day? What&#8217;s up? Well, I&#8217;ll tell you &#8230; I got to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/" target="_blank">Team America: World Police</a> yesterday with <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>, Wublub and Wublub&#8217;s lovely wife, Mrs. Wublub. I just had to write a <a href="/team-america-world-police.html" target="_blank">review</a>, and let you guys know about it!

I have another <a href="/william-shatner-has-been.html" target="_blank">review</a> for William Shatner&#8217;s new album _Has Been_, if you want to read it.

I also wanted to let you know that the reviews are back up and running &#8230; I&#8217;m in the middle of writing the quick-and-dirty dBase manager that I mentioned, so the Puzzles still aren&#8217;t up to snuff, but I&#8217;ll get there.

**Update &#8230;** Wublub has advised me that his wife is not Mrs. Wublub, but rather Gonch. I would be remiss in not posting a correction to the information.
