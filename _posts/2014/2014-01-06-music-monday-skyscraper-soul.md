I&#8217;ve had this Music Monday post sitting around for a while and finally got my act in gear and Â posted it.

This is a fantastic tune that always reminds me of my time living in Toronto. I remember people thinking that, because I was from Saskatchewan, I must&#8217;ve lived on a farm, or that I was a &#8220;farm boy&#8221;. But I grew up in cities. Other than living in Banff, Alberta, for a few years, I&#8217;ve always lived in cities. Maybe you could say that I also have &#8220;steel in my bones.&#8221;
