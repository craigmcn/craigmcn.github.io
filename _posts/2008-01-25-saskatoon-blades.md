Alrighty, so I&#8217;m going to completely rephrase an e-mail that was sent to me so that it makes sense:

A friend of mine has a friend in Saskatoon; we&#8217;ll call the friend, Lee. (We&#8217;ll call him, Friendly?) For a contest sponsored by the [Saskatoon Blades](http://www.saskatoonblades.com/), Lee&#8217;s child submitted a design for a goalie mask and has been selected as a finalist.

The winner of the contest will have the design printed on a goalie mask. The mask will then be worn by one of the Saskatoon Blades&#8217; goalies in a future hockey game. After the game, the mask will be autographed by the goalie and awarded to the artist. If all goes well and Lee&#8217;s child wins, the child will receive the goalie mask printed with his design.

Yes, clarity requires many words. <del>In any case, please visit the Saskatoon Blades website and vote on Mask #2.</del>

For reference, here&#8217;s the e-mail I received (font sizes intact):
