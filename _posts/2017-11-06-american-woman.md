This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_American Woman_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Woman) by [The Guess Who](http://www.theguesswho.com/) from their 1970 album, [American Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Woman_(album)). The [Lenny Kravitz](http://lennykravitz.com/) version is from his 1998 album, [5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_(Lenny_Kravitz_album)).

It was lucky we had &#8220;guess who?&#8221; as a theme for our [sprint retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective) this morning, because I had nothing else for [Music Monday](https://craigmcn.ca/category#music-monday). In a retrospective, we reflect on how the previous sprint went. With this &#8220;guess who?&#8221; theme, the idea was to draw a team member’s name, remark on how we thought this person thought the sprint went, and then let the team guess which team member we drew. I suggested that we should have to sing *American Woman* or *Runnin’ Back to Saskatoon* too.
