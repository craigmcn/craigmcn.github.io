I really have to remember that [my phone](http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details.jsp?globalObjectId=236 "Motorola MOTO Q9c") takes pictures, then I could show you what I&#8217;m talking about. But, alas, no picture, so you&#8217;ll just have to trust me.

Almost 20 years ago, I saved up my money and bought myself a $400 mountain bike. I had done some solid research and I bought myself a great bike. (As with everything, it was outdated by the next year.) And obviously a great bike, because when leaving work the other day, I saw it locked up outside [the mall](http://www.midtownplaza.ca/ "Midtown Plaza, Saskatoon").

The Sekine mountain bike lasted me from about 1990 or 1991 until 1997 when I moved to [Banff](http://www.banff.com/ "Banff.com - Banff's Premier Online Guide to the Canadian Rockies"). I had a new [better] mountain bike by then (on which I had spent well over $1000), so I donated the Sekine to [Bike Doctor](http://www.bikedoctor.ca/ "Bike Doctor Saskatoon"). That last winter of 1996-1997, I rode that bike almost everyday, as it was the most convenient mode of transportation to school. That meant a lot of riding in snow and -30Â°C weather and a lot of falls on ice.

But the bike I saw the other day was in pretty much the same shape as when I dropped it off 12 years ago. Good job, little Sekine!
