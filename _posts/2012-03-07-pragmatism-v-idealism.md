<img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8133385/images/no-plastic-bags.jpg" alt="No Plastic Bags" width="240" height="240" align="left" />The other day, I was asked to sign a petition to ban plastic bags. And while I support the use of reusable bags, it made me think. I certainly don’t like plastic bags [building up in the ocean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pacific_Garbage_Patch "Great Pacific Garbage Patch"), drifting through the streets, lining the fence around the landfill, nor getting stuck in my tree for almost two years. But what is the alternative?

A ban on plastic bags seems reasonable: no plastic bags, no plastic bag garbage. But what if I don’t have a reusable bag with me? Can I hope for a paper bag to be available? And what does that environmental impact look like?

Or maybe I can buy a reusable bag for $1, $2, $3? But then I have an excess of reusable bags. And what do I do with them? Obviously, I have few excuses for not having a bag with me, but sometimes I’ll forget, or not expect to need one.

And then what do I do when I want a plastic bag? My shredded paper is supposed to go into the recycle bin in a plastic bag. I like to wrap shoes in plastic bags before packing them in a suitcase. I like to use a plastic bag for my lunch, so I don’t worry about it leaking in my shoulder bag.

I fully support reducing the number of plastic bags that are used, and educating people about using reusable bags. As long as they’re recyclable, and recycled, I don’t see the need for banning plastic bags.
