So, I&#8217;m done. I only had to cover for 1 week, and the week&#8217;s over. I enjoyed myself. It felt good to share my knowledge and experience with a new, _apparently_ interested, group. I&#8217;m still not sure if I got through to them or that they&#8217;ll make good agents on the phones, but I tried my best. I get to debrief the regular trainer on Wednesday, we&#8217;ll see what she thinks.
