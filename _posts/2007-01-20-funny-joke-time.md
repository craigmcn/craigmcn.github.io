I was waiting to see who would post and it looks like only Gwildor. I think all in all we had a pretty good time at Yuk Yuks Thursday night. There was some weirdness about [she-males](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She-male) that somehow [involuntarily] involved Smokey, Bud and me. I think it was mostly an act, and maybe would fit in somewhere, but it really didn&#8217;t fit in with the rest of the comics in the show, and definitely not with the headliner, [Joanna Downey](http://www.funnybusiness.ca/roster.php?id=57). There was some funny talk about video games and the faked moon landing conspiracy. It was pretty good, although the audience was pretty thin, which I understood wasn&#8217;t completely normal. Of all the comics I only recognized [Mike Wilmot](http://www.mikewilmot.ca/HOME.html) who played [Cousin Carl](http://www.cornergas.com/episodes/?season=1&episode=8) on [Corner Gas](http://www.cornergas.com/); he was really good.
