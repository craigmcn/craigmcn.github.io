Only one more sleep &#8217;til Santa comes, yay!! Actually, I&#8217;ve already opened all my presents, and those I haven&#8217;t opened, I know what they are. But Santa may still have something up his sleeve, you never know!

I&#8217;ll wish everyone a Merry Christmas today, since I won&#8217;t get a chance tomorrow &#8230; I&#8217;ll be away from the interweb &#8230; 🙁  I hope everybody gets everything that they asked for in their letters to Santa. And a happy time visiting with friends and family. I know I had a great time with [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/), JAC, Big A and everybody at Gwilly and Trikie&#8217;s place last weekend. I plan to have an equally good time in London over the next couple of days.

Take care &#8230; and a Meeerrry-eh Chreestmas!!
