I meant to put this up this morning, or from work later, but, well &#8230;Anyway, I have 3 words for my experience Saturday night &#8230; Oh. My. God. [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and I went to see [One Man Star Wars](http://www.onemanstarwars.com/) &#8230; I laughed so hard I choked, there were tears streaming down my face &#8230; It was fantastic!! His [Jabba the Hutt](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/jabba/) was outrageous, his [Han Solo](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/hansolo/) was perfect &#8230; While his [Yoda](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/yoda/) left a little to be desired, it was completely offset by his [Admiral Ackbar](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/ackbar/) (It&#8217;s a traaap!!) and [Nien Nunb](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/niennunb/). (Boy, this [StarWars.com](http://www.starwars.com/) website is packed with stuff!) Anyway, what an excellent show! If [Charles Ross](http://www.onemanstarwars.com/) is still doing the show and comes to your town, go see it! He also does a [One Man Lord of the Rings](http://www.onemanlotr.com/).

In other news, I also went to a celebrity hockey game &#8230; Yes, hockey, people still play it &#8230; It was the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual [PEN Canada](http://www.pencanada.ca/) Great Literary Faceoff. Although the Writers lost last year 4-2 to thePublishers, and the grudge match was on, the Publishers came out 6-5,after a 3<sup>rd</sup> overtime shoot-out. The game MVP was easily Ingrid Randoja, deputy editor of <span style="font-style: italic;">Famous</span> magazine, who put in the wickedest goal in the shoot-out, as well as one of the goals during regulation play.

After hockey it chicken wings at [Gabby&#8217;s](http://www.gabbys.ca/). Very good. While different from [St. Louis&#8217;](http://www.stlouiswings.com/) (which I have scheduled for tomorrow night!), they&#8217;re very good. The reason I like St. Louis&#8217; wings is &#8217;cause they&#8217;re dry. Gabby&#8217;s makes &#8217;em dripping with sauce, which I don&#8217;t much care for. Although, the steaming sauce does give you that bite right from the first inhale. Plus, Gabby&#8217;s had a new server, Hillary, who was pretty cute. It was her first day, she did a great job!

Last but not least &#8230; Sunday afternoon &#8230; A little chicken and ribs with Gwildor, Trikie and Big A. Very delicious.

Alright, that&#8217;s it, go home!
