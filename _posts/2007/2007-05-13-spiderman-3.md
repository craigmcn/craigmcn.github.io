I would love to tell you that the third installment in the [Spiderman](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300) franchise is fantastic and lives up to all expectations, but that would not be true. It&#8217;s packed with 3 bad guys, 2 love interests and an excess of storylines. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t feel that any part of the story was really well-told.

There was [Sandman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandman_%28Marvel_Comics%29), the new [Green Goblin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Goblin) and [Venom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%28comics%29), as well as the conflicts with [Eddie Brock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_%28Eddie_Brock%29), [J. Jonah Jameson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Jonah_Jameson) and [Harry Osborn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Osborn). True, Eddie and Harry are sort of Venom and Green Goblin, but that only makes the story more convoluted. Then there&#8217;s the unfulfilled relationships with [Mary Jane Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson) and [Gwen Stacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stacy). Toss in the flirtations with [Betty Brant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Brant) and Ursula Ditkovich and we&#8217;re knee-deep in romantic subplots.

As I mentioned, none of the stories are well-developed and it&#8217;s really a shame. The song-and-dance numbers were ridiculous. The story about Flint Marko killing [Ben Parker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Parker) is a little hard to believe and goes entirely nowhere. As does the story of Marko&#8217;s sick daughter. The Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and the MJ Watson stories go as far nowhere as they went in [Spiderman 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316654/). The Gwen Stacy story is entirely out of context. The only story that kind of worked was the Eddie Brock/Venom story, but it just sort of came and went.

All in all, it was a fun, action-packed adventure, but there were just too many different storylines that none of them were very effective. However, [Bruce Campbell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0132257/)&#8216;s cameo was HI-larious!

5 out of 10 saltines. Sorry, dudes, this one&#8217;s really a renter.
