[Geek.com](http://www.geek.com/) seems to be concerned that “[Kindle and Kindle Touch don’t ship with a power adaptor](http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/kindle-and-kindle-touch-dont-ship-with-a-power-adaptor-2011103/).” As a [new Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051QVESA/) owner, I can’t say it matters.

For one, the battery lasts forever. (Well, obviously not _forever_, but [orders of magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude) longer than any other device I own.) So I don’t have to charge it all too often. Second, at this point, maybe just pick up a USB charger [like mine](http://www.belkin.com/IWCatProductPage.process?Product_Id=400738) and don’t worry about what kind of adapter you need or which device you need it for. My Kindle came with a standard mini-USB cable, and while I haven’t tried, I’m sure the same mini-USB cable I use for my phone will work for the Kindle.

I like Geek.com, but this seems like a petty complaint.
