This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_I Wanna Be Sedated_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Wanna_Be_Sedated) by
[the Ramones](http://ramones.com/) from their 1978 album,
[Road to Ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_to_Ruin_(Ramones_album)). The [Go-Go’s](http://www.gogos.com/)
version is from a 2001 concert and DVD, Live - In Central Park.

I saw a meme today that at midnight it will be “Ramones time”: 2020, 24 hours to go. I thought it was pretty funny. And I love the Go-go’s.
