So, what&#8217;s the haps, homey? A big nada!! Well, that&#8217;s not completely true. Last Thursday, I went to [Hemispheres](http://www.metropolitan.com/hemis/) with Mommy and the Wolfman. And, I have to say, it was spectacular.Well, I told Daddy-O that I didn&#8217;t have a &#8220;special dinner&#8221;, and that&#8217;s true enough. It was <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> dinner with the fam. But it was very good food, and not food that I would have on a regular basis. I had a beef [carpaccio](http://www.foodreference.com/html/fcarpaccio.html), some roasted quail with wild mushrooms and truffles (which <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> mushrooms, so it was probably truffle <span style="font-style: italic;">oil</span>) and banana cream in [phyllo pastry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllo) for dessert. Dee-licious!

Otherwise &#8230; pretty boring. A little [MxO](http://www.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/), a little [CoD](http://www.callofduty.com/) &#8230; I bought a new headset with microphone for the &#8216;puter, but I haven&#8217;t tested out the [Teamspeak](http://www.teamspeak.org/) yet. I watched the original [Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067992/) on [YTV](http://www.ytv.com/). And I got completely roasted on [Fantastic Four](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/) on the [Hollywood Stock Exchange](http://www.hsx.com/). I bought the Put option (betting that the movie <span style="font-weight: bold;">won&#8217;t</span> do as well opening weekend as predicted) and shorted the Call option (I bet that the bet that the movie would do as well as predicted was false&#8230; whew, that doesn&#8217;t make much sense &#8230; trust me). Well, the movie did better than predicted and I lost 40000 fake dollars. But I made money, $140000 on the same bet for crappy [Dark Water](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382628/)! I guess I came out even.

So, again, not much, really, this weekend. It was back to the same old, same old at work this morning &#8230; \*rolls eyes\*lolls tongue*
