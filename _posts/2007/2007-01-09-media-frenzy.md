Sorry, everybody, not much to report since last time, although I did catch up on my lost sleep from Thursday night. I spent the weekend migrating and verifying data, woo hoo! I set up a new computer with 820 gigabytes of storage space for my several seasons of TV (e.g., every episode of [Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine), [Star Trek: Voyager](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Voyager), [Weeds](http://www.sho.com/sho/weeds/home), [Deadwood](http://www.hbo.com/deadwood/), [Six Feet Under](http://www.hbo.com/six-feet-under), [My Name is Earl](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/) and [Lost](http://abc.go.com/shows/lost); Season 6, 7 and 8 of [Charmed](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158552/); Seasons 5, 6 and 7 of [CSI](http://www.cbs.com/shows/csi/); Seasons 4 and 5 of [CSI: Miami](http://www.cbs.com/shows/csi_miami/); Season 3 of [CSI: NY](http://www.cbs.com/shows/csi_ny/); Season 3 of [Numb3rs](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/); Season 4 of [NCIS](http://www.cbs.com/shows/ncis/); plus a handful of one-offs and movies). I found out the hard way that [Windows 2000](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000) doesn&#8217;t like hard drives larger than 137 GB. I lost a bucketload of files and folders since Windows wouldn&#8217;t read all the partitions on all the drives. However, I found out that had I installed Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 and modified the registry to enable large [logical block addressing (LBA)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_block_addressing) before I started screwing with the drives and partitions, I would have been fine. Damn! So now I&#8217;m in the process of downloading all the disappeared files. Thank goodness I didn&#8217;t lose my entire collection of all the [Astroboy](http://www.astroboy-online.com/) episodes!

Now I need to migrate my music, although there&#8217;s only about 20GB (about 4000 tracks). But before I do, I think I&#8217;ll try to rename the files properly.
