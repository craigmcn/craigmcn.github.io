Having done a little bit of PHP coding for the [Toronto Reel Asian International Film Festival](http://www.reelasian.com), I got free passes to the opening night gala, _[Finishing the Game](http://reelasian.com/blog/?p=24)_. So, last night I went. Why not?

It&#8217;s a really well-made [mockumentary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mockumentary) about completing the movie _[Game of Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death)_ &#8212; unfinished due to the untimely death of [Bruce Lee](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000045/).

I don&#8217;t really know what to say about it. It was hilarious and comparable to classic mockumentaries like _[This is Spinal Tap](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/)_ and _[Drop Dead Gorgeous](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157503/)_. Watch the trailer:
