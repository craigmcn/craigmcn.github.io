Wednesday, Wednesday, so good to me, Wednesday morning, it was all I hoped it would be&#8230; Sorry, that&#8217;s for Monday &#8230; Well here we are again on a fabulous Wednesday morning. It&#8217;s a little early right now for <a href="http://www.freakradio.net" target="_blank">Freak Radio</a> (unfortunately I&#8217;m not keen on DJ Doc), but once ol&#8217; Gwildor&#8217;s on, I&#8217;ll be listening.

It&#8217;s really interesting when you meet people purely by chance who become the sorts of friends that remain friends all your life. You share enough things in common that you have something to talk about or something to do, you know, whatever. Gwildor and I met when we had to sign the paperwork for our new jobs &#8230; this was 3 years ago, they&#8217;re old jobs now. We went for lunch right after, started in training the following Monday, and we&#8217;ve been friends ever since. We&#8217;re even considering — well, we&#8217;re getting under way, really — with a small business venture in web hosting and web design. Gwildor owns a domain already (www.externalgateway.com), and we&#8217;ve gotten Wublub on board, so the three of us will have our sites hosted by externalgateway.com. We just need a few others to join up and make it a money-making venture. All this from a random meeting in a headhunter&#8217;s office to sign papers.

I&#8217;m sure there was something else I had to say, but it can probably wait &#8230; enjoy your Hump Day!
