I can’t believe it’s been almost 20 months since my last [Thoughtful Thursday](/i-think-people-dont-like-coffee.html) post. I definitely didn’t expect my life, or the world, to change as much as it has in that time.

I mentioned in my [Music Monday](/sweet-dreams.html) post this week that there’s a child in my household. This was certainly not true 20 months ago. There’s also his mother, my beautiful, loving partner, and a 9-week-old [cocker spaniel puppy](https://www.instagram.com/simonwaffles/).

Twenty months ago, I had a girlfriend I’d been dating for a little more than a year. A year later we’d moved in together, and seven months after that we moved into a house we bought together. It took a little while for the child to be okay with me moving in with them, and another little while to get him used to the idea of moving to a new home.

A year ago, my partner lost one of her two 16-year-old cats, and a few months later lost the other one. We had discussed new pets a bit after that; the child was unwilling to wait very long before having a new pet. I like dogs, my partner likes cats. The child seems to prefer dogs, but mostly just seemed to want a pet.
