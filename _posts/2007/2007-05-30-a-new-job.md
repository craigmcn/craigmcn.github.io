Funny, the [last time I mentioned new jobs](/hooray-for-new-jobs.html) was about 18 months ago and that was a whole new job ago. Now I&#8217;m up early in the morning, with time to spare to blog, to get ready for my new job that started Monday.

I&#8217;m the _web publisher_ for the old group with whom I worked; the writers who write the procedures manuals and procedural change communications. All of that stuff gets published on a specific intranet site and that&#8217;s where I come in: to get anything published there, it goes through me. I don&#8217;t edit anything and I don&#8217;t write anything, but I make sure it&#8217;s pretty, it meets all the formatting standards and the links all work. It&#8217;s a little demanding, since there&#8217;s always a jillion things in different stages of work that might need my involvement, but it&#8217;s exactly what I wanted to do. At least for now.

I definitely wanted something &#8220;real&#8221; with a &#8220;real&#8221; company doing something that let me use skills developed entirely outside of work or school. I think this adds an element of legitimacy to my &#8220;hobby&#8221;. Well, we&#8217;ll see where it goes and where it takes me.
