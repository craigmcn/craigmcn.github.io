This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Shake It Off_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shake_It_Off) by [Taylor Swift](http://taylorswift.com/) from her 2014 album, [1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_(Taylor_Swift_album)). The [Walk off the Earth](http://www.walkofftheearth.com/) version is from a 2014 performance.

I just love it when bands do multiple fun covers and I don’t have to think too hard about what to post.
