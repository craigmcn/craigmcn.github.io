So I&#8217;m pushing a month with no updates here, my apologies. I was on vacation for a week at my mommy&#8217;s in [The Pas (MB)](http://maps.google.ca/maps?q=maps+the+pas+mb&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&ie=UTF8&split=0&gl=ca&ei=VyGESvLxDZGoMKCXwdYE&ll=53.831055,-101.252747&spn=0.192486,0.430527&z=11&iwloc=A). I was busy working on a couple of websites (paid jobs, yay!). And busy looking for work (so far generally unsuccessful).

I also had a good update for you about the vacuum cleaner salesman who visited me. His product really sucked! This is not a joke, I actually had a vacuum cleaner salesman come to my home and demonstrate [his machine](http://www.filterqueen.com/). It did a super job, but it was also $3000. While I&#8217;m sure it was totally worth the price, I have a bit of an issue with a $3000 vacuum cleaner!

The big project on the go now is to manage more effectively my [Twitter](http://twitter.com/craigmcn), [Facebook](http://facebook.com/craigmcnaughton) and [other](http://www.craigmcnaughton.ca/) status updates. Facebook gets a little cluttered with all my Twitter updates, so I keep my Twitter updates to roughly one per hour, but I&#8217;d like to [tweet](http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/15367) more. I also have some Facebook updates that I&#8217;d like to have go to [my &#8220;professional&#8221; page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Saskatoon-SK/Craig-McNaughton-Web-developerTechnical-writer/85092939522), but they just go to my regular page. So I realize I need my regular Twitter feed, a smaller Facebook feed, another &#8220;professional&#8221; Facebook feed, plus a feed to and from my other website. This sounds like a bucketload of programming feeds, but we&#8217;ll see what happens.

How&#8217;s everybody doing out there?
