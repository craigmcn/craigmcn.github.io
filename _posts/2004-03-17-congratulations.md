Just a quick celebratory note for my friends Tim and Tonia Shia&#8230;their new daughter, ChloÃ« Xiang-Wen Shia was born March 15. Congratulations, Tim and Tonia! New proud Uncles are Howie and Leo, and Aunt Jolene (boy, I hope I got that right).
  
Now I think there&#8217;s 7 or 8 living in the house!

I&#8217;ve also added all the [bagpipe jokes](/bagpipe-jokes) to their own page in _Shared Stuff_&#8230; that way you can see them all at once and laugh all night!
