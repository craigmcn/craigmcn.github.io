Whew! Dodged a bullet this morning! I have this nice little 128MB USB flash drive that I got free from a [CIRA](http://www.cira.ca/) meeting and I&#8217;ve got all my resum√©s, cover letters and saved job postings, as well as bucketload of other stuff. When I grabbed my wallet out of my bag to get my [Metropass](http://www.ttc.ca/Fares_and_passes/Passes/Metropass/index.jsp), the flash drive fell on the ground and the casing popped off. The bare circuit board was sitting on the crummy subway station floor, yuck-aroo! But I tested it out and everything&#8217;s fine. Yay!
