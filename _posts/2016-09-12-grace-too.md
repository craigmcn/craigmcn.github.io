This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Grace, Too_](http://craigmcn.ca/grace-too.html) by [The Tragically Hip](http://thehip.com) from their 1994 album, [Day for Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_for_Night_(The_Tragically_Hip_album)). The [Justin Rutledge](http://www.justinrutledge.com/) version is from his 2014 Tragically Hip cover album, [Daredevil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(Justin_Rutledge_album)).

This is the last in the Tragically Hip tribute series. Although, I expect there'll be more Hip posts in months and years to come.
