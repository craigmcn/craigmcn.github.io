So I was mesmerized on the subway the other day by a dude&#8217;s deformity. He had his upper ear pireced, just like I do, so I noticed it. But I also noticed something odd, so I had to look about a jillion more times to figure out what I was seeing. He had new skin growing over and around the earring he was wearing. It had grown at least a quarter of the way around from the back and and eighth again in the front.Â I would say he didn&#8217;t care for it properly, since I&#8217;ve had no problem with mine in over 4 years. Mine sits fairly loosely in the hole, so it moves around on its own a lot. I have a feeling that his didn&#8217;t move around much, and he didn&#8217;t move it around on his own and now it&#8217;s grown right into his ear. Weird.
