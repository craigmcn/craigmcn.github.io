Today&#8217;s Music Monday entry is [Cyndi Lauper](http://cyndilauper.com/)&#8216;s _[True Colors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Colors_(song))_, the title track from her [second album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Colors_(Cyndi_Lauper_album)), released in 1986. The cover is fromÂ [Artists Against Bullying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artists_Against), a group of Canadian artists, who donated the proceeds from the recording to [Kids Help Phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_Help_Phone).

[As you may remember from last week](http://craigmcn.ca/grief-and-loss.html "Grief and Loss"), I&#8217;m not feeling great right now and this song, it&#8217;s message, and the cover version&#8217;s message really resonate with me. The loss I described related to a break-up that is obviously quite hard for me and letting my feelings out was especially hard.
