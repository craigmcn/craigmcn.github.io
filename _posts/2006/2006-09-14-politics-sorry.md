A short note on politics tonight, since I had to vote today. &#8220;What? Big Cracker, none of the rest of us had to vote, why are you so special?&#8221; Well, little crackettes, there was a by-election in [my riding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkdale-High_Park), because [our MPP](http://www.gerardkennedy.ca/) stepped down to run for the leadership of the [federal Liberal party](http://www.liberal.ca/). I gather there&#8217;s been some mud-slinging during the campaign, but isn&#8217;t that how politics works?

In other political news, [wedding girl](/wedding-fun.html)&#8216;s dad is running for the leadership of a provincial political party and appears to be in the lead. If he wins, he&#8217;ll probably become Premier. I&#8217;m not sure what to think about that. Especially because I&#8217;m pretty sure my political leanings are quite the opposite of his. But I have been thinking that if I ever move back to Saskamatoon, I might run for city council. (Those idiots need a bit of a shake up.) So it might be helpful knowing a powerful politician.

**Update:** [My candidate won](http://results.elections.on.ca/results/2006ByElections/index_PHP.jsp?flag=E&layout=G). Yay!
