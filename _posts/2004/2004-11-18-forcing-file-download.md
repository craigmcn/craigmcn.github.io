My apologies to anyone who tried downloading from my available mp3s. You probably got the file but it was 0 bytes. I dropped new code this morning that seems to be doing the trick now.

Boy, forcing a file download is not as easy as you might think! So, now you can request mp3s by clicking on the track in the &#8216;Now Playing/Recently Played&#8217; section, or clicking on the track in the &#8216;All my MP3s&#8217; listing.

For your inconvenience, I&#8217;ve added a mandatory email field to the MP3 request, so I know who&#8217;s downloading my files!
