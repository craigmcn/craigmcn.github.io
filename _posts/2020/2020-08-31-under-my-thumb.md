This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Under My Thumb_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_My_Thumb) by
[The Rolling Stones](http://rollingstones.com/) from their 1966 album,
[Aftermath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_(Rolling_Stones_album)). The [Streetheart](http://streetheart.ca/)
version is from their 1979 album, [Under Heaven Over Hell](http://www.streetheart.ca/?audiotheme_record=under-heaven-over-hell).

I was looking for a version of the song just to listen to and found this terrific cover.
