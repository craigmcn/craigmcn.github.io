This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Fresh Prince of Bel-Air_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098800/) by [DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Jazzy_Jeff_%26_The_Fresh_Prince) from their 1990 album, [](). The [Kay Pettigrew](https://www.facebook.com/Kay-Pettigrew-85222146159/) version is from their 2008 album, []().

I don’t know why, but somehow I had this song in my head and it kept morphing into [_Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard_](https://youtu.be/Z6VrKro8djw), so I went looking for a good folk version. I really like Kay Pettigrew’s version, but I also found a few more. [Jimmy Fallon as Neil Young](https://youtu.be/yCLn1EYQql0) is pretty good too.
