This is partly last week&#8217;s Thoughtful Thursday post, but mostly something altogether new. It&#8217;s true, faithful readers, that I didn&#8217;t post anything last Thursday. That&#8217;s mostly because what I had to say was really whiny and I expect you&#8217;re getting tired of it. Also, I was pretty exhausted last week from a bunch of things and the post wasn&#8217;t up to my highly-discriminating standard.

I&#8217;d like to draw your attention to one old and two more recent posts to explain, apologize and compromise. The first post is from a few years ago in which [I alert you to the possibility of our discussions ending up in this blog.](little-bit-housekeeping.html "A Little Bit of Housekeeping") I don&#8217;t apologize, but I do admit the possibility that you might not have been aware of our disagreement when it appears here. My intent is not to be passive-aggressive, it&#8217;s more likely that our interaction prompted me to think about weird things and they came out in this blog.

Second, a significant portion of my life and at least some of yours happens on social media. I know far more about some of you than I ever thought I would, especially those of you I see only on occasion, or maybe never. If [I gave the impression](http://craigmcn.ca/your-coherent-story.html "Your Coherent Story") that I would no longer be your friend because of one random thing you posted to Instagram, that was not my intent, but I don&#8217;t know if I can be clearer without sounding like an asshole. My story about you includes all of our interactions and if an increasing number of those interactions contribute to a more negative story about you, I will likely lose interest in that story. Unfortunately, an increasing number of our interactions happen on social media, where neither of us can control the message the other receives. I hope that makes sense and means what I mean.

Finally, if you&#8217;re angry, upset, frustrated, disappointed, or within any other range of emotions, with my posts, feel free to let me know [in an open and honest way](http://craigmcn.ca/communication-v-technology.html "Communication v. Technology"). I&#8217;d like to believe that I&#8217;m open to disagreement and discussion about my posts. Although I might get defensive, you have every right to let me know how you feel, and I&#8217;d like to have the opportunity to respond. Comments here or through Facebook and Twitter are welcome, and might prompt me to call you up to invite you for a beer and chat. I like beer and chatting.
