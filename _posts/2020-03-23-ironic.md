This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Ironic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_(song)) by
[Alanis Morissette](http://alanis.com/) from her 1995 album,
[Jagged Little Pill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagged_Little_Pill). The [Donovan Woods](http://www.donovanwoods.net/)
version is from a 2018 performance for [CBC Music’s Junos 365 Sessions](https://www.cbc.ca/music/junos/donovan-woods-ironic-junos-365-sessions-1.4489475).

I think this is a bit of a fun, silly song, which we all need right now. Anyone who says that most of the situations aren’t ironic are probably right, but why does it matter?
