Holy monkey nuts! Was it already a week ago that I posted last? What the heck have I been doing? No, really &#8230;Â what the heck have I been doing .. ? It&#8217;s almost the end of April and I have been wasting my life! Well, maybe not so much &#8230; I&#8217;ve been riding my bike to work. Not today, mind you, since it&#8217;s pouring rain and I don&#8217;t feel confident trying to ride my bike and hold my umbrella at the same time &#8230; And I&#8217;ve got crackerMail v1.0.1 RC2 almost ready to go. I&#8217;m running it for myself right now, to make sure there&#8217;s nothing massively wrong, and that the changes I wanted to make are actually made. It&#8217;s kinda funny, at the same time I&#8217;m building v1.1, I&#8217;m also working on v2.0. One of the guys at work wants a whole bunch of new features, plus [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s looking for some other updates too.

I&#8217;m so bad .. I buy a bunch of groceries, then I never end up bringing a lunch to work. I brought one yesterday, but then had some errands to run at lunch time, so I ended up at the [Dub](http://www.aw.ca/). Mmm &#8230; Mozza burger! And today &#8230; no lunch, went for Chinese. Bad!
