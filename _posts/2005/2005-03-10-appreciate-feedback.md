I appreciate the feedback I got on the last post &#8230; I didn&#8217;tÂ expect anything quite so astute from Joey Jack! Thanks a bunch, guys, I definitely got the insight I wanted &#8230; although I was hoping for more &#8230;

So the &#8216;puter at home seems to have died. It shut down fine the other day and now I can&#8217;t power it back on. So, you won&#8217;t see anything Now Playing for awhile, but I will try to keep things updated from one of the 2 other &#8216;puters I have, or from work (as I&#8217;m doing now!). I think it&#8217;s the power supply that&#8217;s toast. If I can&#8217;t get it running tonight, I&#8217;ll buy a new power supply tomorrow after work and try that out. If I&#8217;m at [the store](http://www.canadacomputers.com) getting new stuff, I&#8217;ll probably get some more RAM for the machine and another fan for the gaming &#8216;puter.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update</span> (Friday, March 11,19:30ET): The word of the day is Yahoo! Not like the search engine, more like a cowboy, but not quite a Yee-haw! I replaced the power supply on my &#8216;puter and now I&#8217;m cookin&#8217; with gas! Of course, when I was down to the computer store, I picked up another 256MB of RAM &#8230; WooHoo!!
