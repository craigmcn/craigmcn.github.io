So I finally managed to watch the movie [Kick-Ass](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/) the other day, and I can understand why it didn&#8217;t do well in theatres. It tried to be too much. Now I never read the comic book, so maybe it&#8217;s very true to its source, but I doubt it.

We start off with a comic book nerd who decides to buy a costume online and become a superhero; good times. But then we&#8217;re introduced to a real, Batman-esque superhero (i.e., a regular dude with cool gadgets), who willingly, and maybe purposefully, kills his enemies. These two pieces don&#8217;t fit for me.

But the story requires the mistaken identity plot line to introduce and further a second comic book nerd&#8217;s supervillain. I suppose the two comic book nerds are mentored and mirrored by the actual superhero and villain, but it doesn&#8217;t ring true for me. It takes a comic, light-hearted premise and makes it dark and serious.

Plus, I&#8217;m not sure I approve of a 12-year-old girl chopping people&#8217;s legs off or shooting them between the eyes.

It was a good movie, but the transition from teen comic book romance to dark pulp gangster killfest was a little jarring. **7 out of 10** saltines.
