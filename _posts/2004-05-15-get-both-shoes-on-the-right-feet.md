Whew, another week already? I&#8217;ve been at work at least an extra hour every day this week, well, except Monday. Wednesday or Thursday (I don&#8217;t even remember anymore!) I worked an extra 2 hours and yesterday an extra 4. Woo hoo! Overtime pay!! But it&#8217;s really for the kids &#8230; well, immature adults who can&#8217;t help themselves. I really wonder some days how these people get both shoes on theÂ right feet, get them tied up, and get themselves to work.

For those of you wondering (and I&#8217;m sure nobody is), I work at a computer software support help desk, helping what should be mature, knowledgeable people use software to do their jobs. My colleagues and I would be significantly more effective if the callers actually knew their jobs. I mean, I can help them use the software, they really need to know why they&#8217;re using it, what they&#8217;re trying to do with it, and they need to recognize when they&#8217;ve accomplished what they&#8217;re trying to do.

I just picked up my morning coffee &#8230; ahh, coffee, the elixir of life &#8230; it got me thinking. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have to concede that my <a href="http://www.kraftrecipes.com/products/maxwell_house.aspx" target="_blank">Maxwell House</a> Original Blend is probably not the <a href="http://fairtrade.ca/en" target="_blank">fair trade</a> coffee that I <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/business/companies/article.jsp?content=20040517_80554_80554" target="_blank">read about in Maclean&#8217;s</a> this week (with an excellent cover story on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Johanson" target="_blank">(in)famous Sue Johansen</a>). I think fair trade coffee is an excellent idea, paying the farmers no less than what it cost to produce the coffee.
