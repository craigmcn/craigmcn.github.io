This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Gloria_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_(Them_song)) by [Them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Them_(band)) from their 1965 album, [The Angry Young Them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Angry_Young_Them). [The Doors](http://thedoors.com/) version is from their 1983 album, [Alive, She Cried](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alive,_She_Cried).

I’ve been meaning to feature this song for a long while. The song was recorded by The Doors sometime between 1968 and 1970, but wasn’t included on an album until 1983, well after Jim Morrison had died.
