So I justÂ finished [an article on using Ubuntu Linux](http://consumer.hardocp.com/article.html?art=MTI5OCwxLCxoY29uc3VtZXI=) and it&#8217;s almost swayed me to look at all the software I use and see if there&#8217;s a Linux solution. For my main, everyday computer, I surf the web, check e-mail and listen to music, with a little word processing, spreadsheeting and web development thrown in. Of all of that, nothing is unsupported by [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu). I do a little bit of [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/), but I could always use [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/) or Photoshop on my laptop. And I like to convert word-processed documents to PDF, but [OpenOffice](http://www.openoffice.org/) has the same capability. The reviewer said he had major difficulties with games, but I&#8217;m not a huge gamer, so I&#8217;m not too concerned. (If anything, I have a [Win2K](http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/default.mspx) machine for games that hasn&#8217;t let me down yet.) Final word: I&#8217;m going to look into it. I can test it out using a [LiveCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveCD), so I&#8217;ll let you know how it works out.
