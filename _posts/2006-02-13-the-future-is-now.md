This [touchscreen](http://mblog.lib.umich.edu/%7Erdivecha/archives/2006/02/the_world_of_sm.html) thing-a-ma-bob is the wickedest thing I&#8217;ve seen in a long time! It reminds me of the cool monitor/bulletin board the [Tom Cruise](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/) used in [Minority Report](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/).
