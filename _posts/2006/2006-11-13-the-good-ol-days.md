I get so disappointed when I go back to somewhere expecting things to be spectacular and different, and everything&#8217;s the same. I just got back from [Banff](http://www.discoverbanff.com/) and I don&#8217;t know what I was expecting really, but I didn&#8217;t find it. I wandered up to [the hotel](http://www.fairmont.com/banffsprings/) and strolled around. It&#8217;s gorgeous. The renovations that were finished just after I left are really impressive, but the place was empty. The only people around were tourists like me, there were 2 agents on the Front Desk, the Concierge was nowhere to be found, and there were maybe 3 doormen working. I realize it&#8217;s Monday, but it&#8217;s a holiday and this was [Sunshine](http://www.skibanff.com/)&#8216;s opening weekend.

Anyway, I also went for a stroll downtown and found everything pretty much the same as always. There were a few differences, but for the ones I noticed, I couldn&#8217;t remember what they had been originally. It was all very disappointing.
