Boy, I hope [getting killed in Olympic hockey](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2010/02/24/spo-hockey-canada-russia.html) pushes [Alexander Ovechkin](http://capitals.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8471214) (and [Alexander Semin](http://capitals.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8470120) and [Semyon Varlamov](http://capitals.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8473575)) to get my [Washington Capitals](http://capitals.nhl.com/index.html) a [Stanley Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup), for once in my 15-year fanshipness. The Caps are leading the league, I just hope they can keep it going!

Oh, and I guess (although the Olympics kind of bug me) congratulations on Canada&#8217;s Olympic hockey win.
