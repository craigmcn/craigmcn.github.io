I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve been tiring you with all the [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/); I know poor Ben doesn&#8217;t even like the group, or maybe just their music. I have at least one more before I finish with them, but here&#8217;s another artist that has gotten me through a difficult time: [Melissa Auf der Maur](http://xmadmx.com/)&#8216;s [_Followed the Waves_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Followed_the_Waves), the first single from her 2004 debut solo album, [Auf der Maur.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auf_der_Maur_(album))

Auf der Maur came out early in 2004 and it took me awhile to track it down, so it was probably summer by the time I picked it up for myself. My Nana (my Dad&#8217;s mom) died in September 2004 and I spent a week in London (Ontario) helping to sort out her house. I had a rental car and had brought a handful of compact discs with me to listen toâ€”random local radio stations weren&#8217;t going to cut it. I found myself just letting the album shuffle and repeat for four or five days while I drove around in that car. I don&#8217;t know if it made me feel better or just gave me something else to focus on, but listening to it always brings back memories.
