It&#8217;s all about the [haggis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haggis), boys and girls. I won&#8217;t go into any great detail, since with the magic of the interweb I can link to everything, I&#8217;ll just say that today is [Rabbie Burns&#8217; Day](http://www.robertburns.org/suppers/). Scotland&#8217;s national bard, Robert Burns gave us &#8220;O my Luve&#8217;s like [a red, red rose](http://www.robertburns.org/works/444.shtml), > That&#8217;s newly sprung in June&#8221; and the poem _[To a Mouse](http://www.robertburns.org/works/75.shtml)_ that gave [John Steinbeck](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/702-8530229-7963254?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books-ca&field-author=John%20Steinbeck) the title for _[Of Mice and Men](http://www.amazon.ca/Mice-Men-John-Steinbeck/dp/0140177396/sr=8-1/qid=1170117583/ref=sr_1_1/702-8530229-7963254?ie=UTF8&s=books)_ (&#8220;The best-laid schemes o&#8217; mice an &#8216;men > Gang aft agley&#8221;). So I&#8217;m off to [Back to the Garden](http://backtothegarden.foodpages.ca/) for haggis with [RLP](http://www.myspace.com/ryanlpatterson) and [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/century/)
