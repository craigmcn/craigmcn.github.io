This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Best of You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_You) by
[Foo Fighters](http://foofighters.com/) from their 2005 album,
[In Your Honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Your_Honor). The acoustic
version is from their 2006 album, [Skin and Bones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_and_Bones_(Foo_Fighters_album)).

I just went looking for “acoustic covers of pop songs”, but found “acoustic versions” and was pretty happy with this one. I actually love how Dave Grohl’s vocal isn’t significantly different from the original version.
