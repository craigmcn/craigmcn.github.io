Taking a page from the Smokey book of [Bacon](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) and going [Pink for October](http://pinkforoctober.org/) (I might not be able to handle it for the whole month, but I&#8217;ll certainly try). I supported the [CIBC Run for the Cure](http://www.cibcrunforthecure.com/), because I know several people who participated. And I&#8217;m partial to bandwagon-jumping, mostly just to make people aware that there&#8217;s stuff going on out there. In the world. Where things get done. I&#8217;m not necessarily saying I&#8217;m a doer, but I at least pass along the info. My [stepsister-in-law](http://www.donnahorn.ca/) survived [breast cancer](http://www.cbcf.org/Pages/default.aspx), my step-dad survived [prostate cancer](http://www.prostatecancer.ca/), my uncle, grandfather and grandmother died from [lung cancer](http://www.lung.ca/diseases-maladies/cancer-cancer_e.php), and my other grandfather died from <span class="bottomLink"><a href="http://www.themmrf.org/living-with-multiple-myeloma/">multiple myeloma</a>, so there is definitely some family connection. It&#8217;s a wicked good cause. Get into it!<br /> </span>
