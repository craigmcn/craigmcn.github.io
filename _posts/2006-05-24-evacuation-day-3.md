Woo Hoo! Wow! Is my apartment ever fucked up! I stopped in again today, mostly to give you an update on the progress, but under the pretense of checking on my downloads (which are finished, but I&#8217;ve started some new ones!). The hole in the kitchen is filled, as are the hole in the furnace room and the ditches in the laundry room and bathroom. Yes, ditches. They run the whole length of the bathroom and laundry room. But, again, they&#8217;re filled, so the work must be mostly done. However there is still a pile of dirt in the kitchen, only it&#8217;s moved to where the fridge goes, and another pile in my beautifully carpeted hallway (there&#8217;s thick, solid cardboard under the dirt).

I had quite an adventure getting at my computer to check the downloads. I had to get across the pile of dirt, then move the fake door that&#8217;s blocking the doorway into the office. The office has a door, but I asked to have it left off. So now it&#8217;s been propped up in front to block the dirt, but I have to do some fancy maneuvering to get it open enough to get into the office.

All in all, good times. Considering my first post got some solid responses, I thought maybe you were left in awkward silence after my hedonistic, strip poker comment, but [Smokey](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) jumped in in fine form &#8230; You&#8217;re <span style="font-weight: bold;">so</span> invited, Big Shooter!
