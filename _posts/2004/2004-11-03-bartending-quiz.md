Nothing special, just thought I&#8217;d let you know (if you care) my <a href="bartending.php" rel="nofollow">bartending quiz</a> is ready. If ever you wanted to review for a test at the <a href="http://www.bartendingontario.com" target="_blank">Bartending School of Ontario</a>, this is the perfect thing!

Ahh, the joys of Microsoft. So, I have a <a href="http://www.minidisc.org/part_Sony_MZ-NF610.html" target="_blank">Sony Net MD</a> minidisc player. It uses <a href="http://www.openmginfo.com/overview/index.html" target="_blank">OpenMG</a> software for writing my music files to the discs. The other day, I was trying to update some tracks on one of the discs, but kept getting the standard &#8216;blah blah has generated errors and will be closed&#8230;&#8217; I upgraded to v2 from v1.5 and still didn&#8217;t fix the problem. Then I get a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/887811" target="_blank">&#8216;Windows Update&#8217; notification</a> that if I installed a previous update that OpenMG would stop working, and to install the new patch to fix the problem. F&#8212;in&#8217; Microsoft!
