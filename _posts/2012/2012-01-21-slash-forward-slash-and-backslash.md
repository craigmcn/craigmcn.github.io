Something that bugs me is the specific use of “backslash” (“\”) when people mean forward slash (“/”, which is commonly referred to as slash). There is only one place I know that you need a backslash and that’s in [DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS "DOS") file structures (C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe). And, yes, that means [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/home "Windows"), too. Everywhere else, only slashes are needed.

“Uhh, no, websites are h-t-t-p-colon-backslash-backslash-w-w-w….” Actually, that’s not true. “Well, then the address is twitter.com-backslash-ICHCheezburger.” Nope, forward slash.

Or just slash. And not [Slash](http://youtu.be/cs0C9M5ahvQ "Slash - Solos").
