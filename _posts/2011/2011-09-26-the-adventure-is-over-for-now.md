I think I mentioned that I was running. Training, I guess; running and walking in intervals to work up to a full 5 kilometre run. Well, that’s over for a little while, I seem to have injured my knee. My left knee is very, very sore toward the inside, just below the kneecap. I tried using my sister’s knee brace, which helped not at all. So, some ice, some ibuprofen, and I seem to be alright, but it’s been going on for almost two weeks. I’m going to take break from running for the week, maybe just walking instead, and see if I feel any better. Then it might be time to find a doctor.
