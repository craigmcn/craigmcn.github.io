I was planning on a nice Happy Easter blog over the past weekend, and, surprise, it didn&#8217;t get done. I got a funny e-mail from Wisedad (yesterday wasÂ the big day!) and intended to <a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/bunnies.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">post the picture</a>, but it didn&#8217;t happen. And I have no excuse. I did pretty much nothing all weekend. Except to go for lunch with my uncle and aunt out to the [Butler&#8217;s Pantry](http://www.butlerspantry.ca/butlers/Reviews.html). I got some [delicious chocolate](http://www.laurasecord.ca/) from my daddy and stepmom, so I&#8217;ll be rationing the enjoyment for the week.
