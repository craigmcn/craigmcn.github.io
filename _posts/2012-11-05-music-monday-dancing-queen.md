I&#8217;ve been on the hunt for interesting covers and stumbled onto [ABBA](http://www.abbasite.com/)&#8216;s 1976 international hit, [_Dancing Queen_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Queen), covered by [U2](http://www.u2.com/index/home) during the 1993 Zoo TV tour. I think the coolest part is that they were joined by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus on stage for the track as the tour reached Stockholm.
