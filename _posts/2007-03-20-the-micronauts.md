I have to apologize profusely to Rob, Mark, Tim and Ali. I went to see their show last Tuesday at [the Tranzac](http://www.tranzac.org/) and I&#8217;m only singing their praises today. Their project, The Micronauts, is an interesting and excessively fun time.

The name derives from the instruments the boys are playing. Tiny ones. Tim has a set of drums for his 3 year old daughter, Ali plays [melodica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodica) and a tiny electronic keyboard, Mark plays a tiny sax and Rob has a tiny guitar. Watching these guys play these tiny instruments was hilarious in and of itself, but they also play some fun, cheesy, classic tunes. For example, [Survivor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_%28band%29)&#8216;s _Eye of the Tiger_ and [Tears for Fears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tears_for_fears)&#8216; _Everybody Wants to Rule the World_. One thing that killed me was when Mark put down his tiny sax and swapped it for an even tinier sax.

Rob was in town from New York, so I don&#8217;t expect to see another Micronauts show in the near future, but it was a super fun experience that I won&#8217;t forget.
