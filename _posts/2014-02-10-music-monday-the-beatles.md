I haven&#8217;t been listening to [Tom Power](http://music.cbc.ca/#/profile/Tom-Power) and his _Under the Covers_ feature on [CBC Radio 2](http://music.cbc.ca/#/radio2) in the mornings, so I&#8217;ve kind of been running out of ideas for cover comparisons. I&#8217;d hoped to be running into new music or having some inspiration of some kind, but that hasn&#8217;t really happened.

But given yesterday&#8217;s 50th anniversary of [the Beatles](http://www.thebeatles.com/) appearance on [the Ed Sullivan show](http://www.edsullivan.com/), I&#8217;ll give you this video.
