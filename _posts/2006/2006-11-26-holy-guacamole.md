I felt the need to break the weekend up a bit, to make room for [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) in its own space and my other ramblings in their space. So, here&#8217;s the ramblings&#8230;.

Games night over at Shuttergirl and RLP&#8217;s place last night. [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/) was there, as was Wild Erbunch, and , umm, D and F (hmm &#8230; another two people who need nicknames). [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/) will be surprised that I didn&#8217;t kick ass at SceneIt?, but I was holding back a little. But then I managed to be a valued team member at [Cranium](http://store.cranium.com/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=0_0&products_id=1). Our team won, but maybe only because we didn&#8217;t have to do any Sculptorades (and RLP (on the opposing team) was inebriated by the [lychee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychee) [daiquiris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiquiri)). Big Cracker brought honour and glory by solving that &#8220;stolen into afar&#8221; was the anagram of &#8220;National Forest&#8221;.

But the real highlight of the evening was Big Cracker&#8217;s [guacamole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guacamole). No seriously, I think this was some of the best gwok I&#8217;ve ever had. A little too much garlic for some, but not for me.

  * 2 ripe avocados
  * the juice of 1 lime
  * 3 cloves garlic, pressed
  * 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
  * 1/2 tomato, finely chopped

  1. mash avocados
  2. add lime juice and garlic
  3. add onion and tomato
  4. mix thoroughly
  5. serve with tortilla chips and &#8230; Enjoy!

It was seriously some of the best guacamole I&#8217;ve ever eaten. I&#8217;m patting myself on the back right now.

Oh, and happy belated birthday to [VeeDub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/), it was Friday.
