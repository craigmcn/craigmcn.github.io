So I learned first-hand the hazards of being environmentally conscious. As you know, I ride my bike to work &#8230; No, not everyday, but I try hard. Well yesterday on my way home — I would have written this yesterday, after I got home, but I needed to dry out — I was absolutely drenched! The rain came down in huge drops, and I was soaked almost immediately, so it really didn&#8217;t matter by then that I still had <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of the way still to go. And then the rain started coming down in even larger drops &#8230; which I didn&#8217;t even think was possible. The only saving grace was that the rain was warm. So it was like taking a shower with my clothes on &#8230; not completely unpleasant, but uncomfortable. And at least my hands weren&#8217;t frozen to my handlebars!

The rain made the air so much more humid that my clothes, that I hung up overnight, were still noticeably damp this morning. Good times!! Maybe I need a [rain hat](http://www.umbrellahat.net/).

Deep thought for the day&#8230;
