Actually, I&#8217;m posting this just because it&#8217;s been almost a week since I last posted and I felt I should let people know what&#8217;s going on. And, as you wait with [bated](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bate) breath, because the adventurous Big Cracker is always entertaining, there&#8217;s really nothing to tell. Unfortunate, I know. Other than a potluck lunch at work yesterday, and a new Big Cracker food creation, it&#8217;s been pretty quiet. I&#8217;ve been re-running [Season 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/episodes?season=3) of [Star Trek: Deep Space Nine](http://www.startrek.com/page/star-trek-deep-space-nine) and I managed to get all my Christmas shopping done, wrapped and mailed. Woo! I had to bail on D&D last night, since I had to go to the dentist for some kind of treatment on a couple of my molars. Although, I did spend the extra time at home getting a pretty decent score ([IMO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO_(in_my_opinion)#IM); it was 73) in [Tower Defence](http://www.onemorelevel.com/games.php?game=415).

My food creation? Smoked turkey tortilla rolls:

<ul class="blog">
  <li>
    6 flour tortillas (at room temperature)
  </li>
  <li>
    250mL spreadable cream cheese<br /> <em>I used roasted red pepper cream cheese.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    250mL guacamole<br /> <em>see <a href="/holy-guacamole.html">my guacamole recipe,</a> minus the onion and tomato</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    about 300g thinly sliced smoked turkey breast
  </li>
  <li>
    On each tortilla: <ol class="blog">
      <li>
        spread the cream cheese thinly almost to edge of tortilla
      </li>
      <li>
        lay turkey slices to cover same area
      </li>
      <li>
        spread guacamole
      </li>
      <li>
        roll tightly, periodically lifting slighty to ensure ingredients are not squeezed out
      </li>
      <li>
        refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours
      </li>
      <li>
        immediately prior to serving, slice diagonally into 4-5cm wide slices
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Enjoy!
  </li>
</ul>
