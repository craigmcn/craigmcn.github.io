Alrighty, I&#8217;m getting ready to head back to Saskatoon; just finishing up some laundry, packing, etc. I just got off the phone with my sister who called from our new house. Yay!

I was offered, and I took, a half day at work today. Cool, some extra time to get stuff done at home before I go away for a week. But, man, for the day it turned out to be, I&#8217;m not sure I want to come back. For some idiotic reason, there are 50 things that have deadlines over the next week, half of which involve me. I&#8217;ve had this time off booked for months, what kind of moron sets deadlines around the same time if I&#8217;m the one who has to do the work to meet them? What a bunch of retards. (Sorry, no offense meant to mentally challenged people; I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re generally more thoughtful.)

&#8220;Can you get this done today?&#8221;
  
&#8220;Yup, no problem.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Oh, but do these 10 other things first.&#8221;
  
&#8220;Oh, then no, I can&#8217;t get it done today.&#8221;

Good thing I can get 8 hours worth of work done in 3 and a half!
