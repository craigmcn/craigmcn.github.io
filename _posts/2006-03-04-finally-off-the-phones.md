Oh. My. Gawd! It&#8217;s over. No more phones. And now I realize that I have to tell my boss that she can never put me back on the phones. Ever. There is no way that I&#8217;ll be able to do it again. Seriously, I spent several minutes each morning agonizing over whether to get out of bed, then over whether to go to work, then again whether to just get up and go home. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s words for my extreme negative attitude.

At the same time, I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a way to make it better. And the re-organization implemented last November, while I thought it was a good idea at the time, is not the right way. I don&#8217;t know&#8230;.

Go Rock Go! Another crushing defeat served up by the [Toronto Rock](http://www.torontorock.com/) to the terrifyingly under-sized [Minnesota Swarm](http://www.mnswarm.com/)! [Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) hooked us up with tickets for last night&#8217;s game. The crowning achievement was when the goalie, [Bob &#8220;Whipper&#8221; Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Watson_(lacrosse)) came out of his crease, behind a Minnesota player, [Ryan Cousins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cousins). Cousins caught a pass and turned to run toward the goal, but Whipper was there to check him and laid him out flat! HI-larious!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Clarification</span>
  
Just to clarify (thanks, Wublub, for bringing it to my attention), I have not quit my job. My return to the phones was simply for the busy 2-week period for the RRSP contribution deadline. I&#8217;m now off the phones and back to my regular work as &#8220;all-around go-to guy&#8221;. To provide even more clarity, I&#8217;m looking for new work. Preferably as a technical writer or a web developer &#8230; Any leads?
