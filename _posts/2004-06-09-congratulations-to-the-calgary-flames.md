So, Wednesday morning, a couple days late, but I&#8217;ll put in a little note of congratulations to the <a href="http://www.calgaryflames.com" target="_blank">Calgary Flames</a>. They put on a good show and came from 6<sup>th</sup> place in the Western Conference to 2<sup>nd</sup> in the league. Way to go! There&#8217;s always next year.

Also, equally late, I got the chance to see an armload of movies this past weekend: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/" target="_blank">The Day After Tomorrow</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300556/" target="_blank">Timeline</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337/" target="_blank">Paycheck</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0304141/" target="_blank">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</a>. All very good movies. I&#8217;ve the read the books _Timeline_ and _Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban_, and was a little bit disappointed by the film version. But I have to qualify that by saying the books are significantly longer and more detailed, and I understand the screenwriters and directors have to find ways to tell a similar story without having to include all the details. And I think they succeeded. You can check out the reviews once I&#8217;ve finished them all. (Tue. June 15 &#8211; 2 reviews finished: <a title="The Day After Tomorrow" href="http://craigmcn.ca/day-after-tomorrow.html" target="_blank">The Day After Tomorrow</a> and <a title="Timeline" href="http://craigmcn.ca/timeline.html" target="_blank">Timeline</a>)

And, well, Gwildor and I are in good shape on the Settlers of Catan online version (tentatively called Hexed Peasants, to avoid copyright infringement). I actually made a solid contribution this week: I came up with a way to add the appropriate letter to each hexagon, including not adding the letter to the Desert hex. I&#8217;m quite proud of myself, and now have a real stake in the game, that I didn&#8217;t feel I had before.

**Update:** I just got back from downtown, with a new heatsink and fan (which in my Chemical Engineering lingo I prefer to call a cooling tower) for the new computer. I have installed it, attached the temperature sensors, and powered the computer on. YAY HAY! and WOO HOO! It runs like a charmer. The processor is still a little hot, 41.5 °C, with the fan at 4250 rpm &#8230; this was while installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/riseofnations/" target="_blank">Rise of Nations</a>.
