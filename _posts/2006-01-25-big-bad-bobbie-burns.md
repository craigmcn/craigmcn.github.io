So, it&#8217;s January 25, the anniversary of [Robbie Burns](http://www.rabbie-burns.com/the_man/index.cfm.html)&#8216; birth (way back in 1759). It&#8217;s a day of [bagpipes](http://www.bagpiper.com/), [kilts](http://www.kiltmen.com/) and [haggis](http://www.scottishhaggis.co.uk/), yay! I think I may stop by one of my local eateries ([Back to the Garden](http://backtothegarden.foodpages.ca/)) who were advertising haggis. I&#8217;ll have to have a thick stout or a tasty scotch to go with it.
