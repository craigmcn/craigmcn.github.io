This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Higher Ground_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Ground_(Stevie_Wonder_song)) by [Stevie Wonder](http://steviewonder.net/) from his 1973 album, [Innervisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innervisions). The [Red Hot Chili Peppers](http://redhotchilipeppers.com/) version is from their 1989 album, [Mother's Milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Milk).

Thinking of [_Don't Stop Believin'_](/dont-stop-believin.html), this was a &#8220;classic rock covers&#8221; search. It looks like I&#8217;m going to start finding it difficult to find covers I haven't posted before.
