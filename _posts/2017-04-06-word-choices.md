Over the last few months I’ve heard about some word choices that better represent the idea being conveyed. There was even [a browser extension](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/this-google-chrome-extension-replaces-political-correctness-with-something-more-accurate_us_55c82605e4b0923c12bd4a91) that would do the first replacement right within the web page.

1. Political correctness = treating people with respect
   - For example: Has America gone crazy over treating people with respect?
  
Does that not sound completely ridiculous?

2. [Government (gummint) = democracy](http://www.alternet.org/comics/government-versus-democracy)
   - For example: Democracy needs to get out of the way of business!

While I don’t have any clever replacements of my own, I think a number of ideas aimed at fairness and equity, which are often used negatively, could use some replacements: socialism, universal healthcare, feminism, basic income&#8230;
