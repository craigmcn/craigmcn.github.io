Not much to say, really. I haven&#8217;t done a whole heck ofÂ a lot this week &#8230; I ended up at the [Manor Arms](http://torontopubs.com/pub/manorarms) pub, not [St. Louis](http://www.stlouiswings.com/), for wings Tuesday. St. Louis was PACKED! But I managed to get there last night with [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) while we were waiting for the oil change place to free up.

I had a great chat with Joey Jack over wings at the Manor Arms. He mentioned that he and his co-workers were entertained by my [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/) [Roll up the Rim to Win](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/index.php) information. I just wanted say that since the contest is over, the info has come off the site. Sorry. I was 1 in 13 (as compared to the advertised odds of winning of 1 in 9), if you really wanted to know.

Another 2 weeks and I&#8217;m on vacation to Saskabush! It&#8217;ll be nice to see the fam&#8217; again, and all the weirdos who are my friends! Woo Hoo!
