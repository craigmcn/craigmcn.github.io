Do you think someone thought that I&#8217;d be interested in an e-mail with this subject line? &#8220;My peenis is always hard and is able to move without interruption!&#8221; Obviously, the sender figured that by cleverly adding an e to penis my spam catcher would be fooled. But since part of my spam-catching is done with my own two eyes, I wasn&#8217;t fooled. I was about to dump the e-mail in the trash, but I was at least compelled to read it. The product &#8220;is ready to contribute to your durability, confidence and happiness.&#8221; And it will &#8220;[keep] her satisfied tonight and any night in the future. She&#8217;ll love it!&#8221; I don&#8217;t even know what it is. And, based on the subject line, I&#8217;m not sure what the problem is. Is _my_ penis always hard? I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s exactly a problem. Well, I suppose that _would_ be a problem. Or is this guy telling me that _his_ penis is always hard? In which case, I don&#8217;t think I care. I can&#8217;t believe that someone thought this would entice meÂ to visit what is most likely a virus- or spyware-laced website.
