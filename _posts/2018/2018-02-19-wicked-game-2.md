This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Wicked Game_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_Game) by [Chris Isaak](https://www.chrisisaak.com/) from his 1989 album, [Heart Shaped World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Shaped_World_(Chris_Isaak_album)). The [Three Days Grace](http://threedaysgrace.com/) version is from their 2007 album, [One-X (iTunes edition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-X#Track_listing).

I've been absent for a while and in my own head. I thought I’d get back into these posts, which have always been a lot of fun. This one came up in a quick search of &ldquo;hard rock covers of pop songs&rdquo;, and I’ve only included one other cover of this song in my [Music Monday](https://craigmcn.ca/category#music-monday) posts.
