I only just started hearing the term [Snack Culture](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/snack.html) within the last few days, but I get the impression that it&#8217;s been around for at least a couple of weeks. The idea is that there is a [trend to shorter, more immediate entertainment](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/snackminifesto.html), rather than standard, full-length movies, albums, TV, etc. But at the same time, we seem to be [getting into longer forms](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/snacklash.html) of entertainment that require longer term commitment. Personally, I&#8217;m deeply involved in [Lost](http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/index), which is 45 minutes per week. If I wanted to get into it now, I&#8217;d have to start from the beginning to get caught up; that&#8217;s 46 episodes at 45 minutes each&#8211;34.5 hours of television. I got into [Deadwood](http://www.tv.com/shows/deadwood/) in it&#8217;s 3rd season, and had to start from season 1. Mind you, it was only 12 episodes per season.

Even though we&#8217;ve gotten away from the [vinyl LPs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_album) and into [MP3s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mp3), and away from epsiodic TV into [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/browse?s=mp) clips, we&#8217;ve also gotten into [playlists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist) and television [serials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(radio_and_television)). The more things change, the more they stay the same.
