Well, first of all, Happy Thanksgiving. I&#8217;m thankful for the friends and family I have, and with whom I can share all the good times. I spent my weekend with my uncle and aunt, and with my great aunt and her friend. We had a fantastic Thanksgiving dinner and some fine conversation.

The title of this blog relates to some questions that have arisen about my love of the [Washington Capitals](http://www.washingtoncaps.com/). It all dates back to the Stanley Cup playoffs of 1994 (or maybe &#8217;95, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it was my 2nd year of university). My buddies and I were talking about the playoffs and what-not, and they asked which team I cheer for. Well, at the time I didn&#8217;t cheer for anybody, but the first name out of my mouth was &#8220;the Washington Capitals?&#8221; If I remember correctly, they didn&#8217;t make the playoffs that year, but they have made the playoffs once or twice since. I&#8217;ve always maintained that I&#8217;ll buy an official [Kolzig](http://www.nhl.com/ice/player.htm?id=8448535) jersey as soon as they win the [Stanley Cup](http://www.hhof.com/htmlSilverware/silver_splashstanleycup.shtml). With [Ovechkin](http://capitals.nhl.com/club/player.htm?id=8471214)Â this year, they have a solid chance, although they&#8217;re only sitting at 2-2 right now. So, in conclusion, it was all a fluke, it was the first thing I could think of. But I&#8217;m sticking with them!
