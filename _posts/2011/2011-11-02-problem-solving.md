I posted yesterday about [Terry Fallis’ _The Best Laid Plans_](http://terryfallis.com/the-best-laid-plans/ "Terry Fallis' The Best Laid Plans") and today I have another idea that stems from the book. One of the protagonists is an engineering professor-turned-rookie politician and he realizes that solving political problems is no different than solving engineering problems:

> What are the knowns? What are the unknowns? What are the constants? What governing laws are at play?

I don’t know that that’s what I think of when I go about solving a problem, but I’m going to try it. I have a couple of projects at work that require a new way of doing things, and I think that a full analysis of knowns, unknowns, constants, and laws (to a certain degree) will go a long way to getting me to a solution, rather than the extended flailing that I sometimes feel I do.

Thanks again, Terry Fallis!
