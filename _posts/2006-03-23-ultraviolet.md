I have exactly one word for [Ultraviolet](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0370032/) &#8230; terrible. I don&#8217;t mean that no one should go see it, it&#8217;s not entirely unwatchable, I actually had a decent time. But the movie really isn&#8217;t all that good. The story&#8217;s alright, if a little cheesy. The action sequences and camera and lighting effects are well done. But the dialogue is unnatural and doesn&#8217;t fit at all with the time and place. And the acting is underwhelming, at best. Milla Jovovich is absolutely stunningly sexy, but that doesn&#8217;t redeem her lacklustre performance.

3.5 saltines out of 10 from the Big Cracker.
