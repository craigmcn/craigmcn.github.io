WOW! Sunday already? What have I done with my week? Oh, yeah, now I remember &#8230; busy, busy!

I was over to h! is for Hulk&#8217;s place for dinner Wednesday &#8230; Fantastic! He cooked up some excellent spicy chicken with red peppers, tofu with eggplant, and Chinese broccoli &#8230; did I mention h! is Chinese? Yeah, well, he is. After dinner I tried to help him fix his computer .. no luck. I really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up. His DVD burner burns data and movie DVDs, and plays them back. It won&#8217;t recognize data CD-Rs, but is fine with CD-RWs. But the discs burned with the DVD-burner don&#8217;t read in his other DVD-ROM drive &#8230; I couldn&#8217;t figure it out.

My <a href="http://www.bartendingontario.com" target="_blank">bartending class</a> finished Thursday, but I still have the final exam to write. I can write it any time I want. The instructor said he&#8217;s had people come back 3 years later to write the test. So I guess I&#8217;ve got some time to study, if I need it.

Externalgateway.com is almost ready for a grand opening. I spent most of Friday night writing javascript for the new account request form. I finally got the logic and the math worked out.

And, last night, I was over to <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and <a href="http://trikie.tripod.com/" target="_blank">Trikie</a>&#8216;s place for dinner and <a href="http://www.catan.com/" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a>. We had some very nice Chinese food and 3 games of Settlers. Trikie was thinknig we could play 3 games and each win 1, but Gwildor won the last one &#8230; and had I been able to get one more turn in, I would&#8217;ve won it. Bastard!
