Funny times. We&#8217;ve had a bit of snow here in the [Toontown](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/) over the last little while and I&#8217;m a little tired of it. There&#8217;s this program in town for rewarding for the special people who shovel other people&#8217;s sidewalks: [Snow Angels](http://www.saskatoon.ca/DEPARTMENTS/Infrastructure%20Services/Public%20Works/Roadways/Snow%20and%20Ice/Pages/SnowAngels.aspx). There&#8217;s advertising around [admonishing](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/admonish) everyone to &#8220;Be a Snow Angel&#8221;.

There&#8217;s a [secondary program](http://www.saskatoon.ca/DEPARTMENTS/Infrastructure%20Services/Public%20Works/Roadways/Snow%20and%20Ice/Pages/SidewalkSnowClearing.aspx) by which you can report your neighbours for not clearing their sidewalks within 48 hours of a significant snowfall. I choose to call those people&#8211;the people who report others&#8211;the &#8220;Snow A-holes&#8221;.
