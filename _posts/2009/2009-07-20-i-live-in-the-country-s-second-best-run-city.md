Apparently, [Saskatoon is Canada&#8217;s second-best run city](http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/07/16/canadas-best-and-worst-run-cities/). Thanks [Maclean&#8217;s](http://blog.macleans.ca/2009/03/05/the-most-dangerous-cities-in-canada/), but you suck.

With their [highly overrated University rankings](http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2008/12/19/our-18th-annual-rankings/) and their [Most dangerous cities rankings](http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/03/05/the-most-dangerous-cities-in-canada/), I can&#8217;t take their rankings seriously. And even so, when I lived in Toronto, there was almost nowhere I couldn&#8217;t go via public transit; in Saskatoon, there are very few places I _can_ go. In Toronto, I could put out all my recycling, all my composting and all my garbage for the city to collect; in Saskatoon, I compost my own organics and _pay_ to have a private company pick up my recycling. So, what services am I getting here that rate #2, but only rate Toronto #10?

Again, thanks but no thanks, Maclean&#8217;s. You suck.
