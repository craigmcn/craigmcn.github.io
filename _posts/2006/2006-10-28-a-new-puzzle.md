The other day at work our funny little team leader gave us a kind of team-building exercise. He broke the larger team into smaller groups and gave each group a printout of a spreadsheet. Supposedly, the quiz is an entrance exam for [Mensa](http://www.canada.mensa.org/home.htm), but I highly doubt it. Anyway, we had to solve as many of the puzzles as we could. The team with the most solved got $2 gift certificates for [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.ca/). I&#8217;d seen it before, and I&#8217;m a pretty smart little cracker, so of course my group won. Anyway, I <a href="mensa.php" rel="nofollow">webified the quiz</a> and put it up on the site for your enjoyment.
