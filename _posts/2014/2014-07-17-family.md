I belong to [a blended family](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family#Blended_family); yes, I looked it up. Most of friends are aware of my Dad, my Mom, my sister and my niece (my sister&#8217;s daughter), and that my parents are divorced and remarried. When I talk about my sister, most of them know who I&#8217;m talking about. But some of my newer friends and acquaintances might ask whether I&#8217;m talking about my sister in Saskatoon or my sister on the west coast. When I talk about my brother, my older friends might ask who I&#8217;m even talking about.

I refer to my stepmom and stepdad each by their first name, and I have decided to refer to my stepsiblings as my siblings. Certainly the relationships are different, but not so different that I need to use different kinds of words for them. My oldest sister is married and has stepdaughters, so I don&#8217;t know if that makes them stepnieces, and my stepmom has her family, so I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re stepcousins and step-aunts and -uncles, but all of these people have first names, so I can just call them by their names.

I don&#8217;t know that I had a real point here, but I think it&#8217;s interesting how attached we are sometimes to the definition of family, and perhaps how awkward it is when that definition changes. Again, for some of my friends, I have a somewhat nuclear family, but for me, it&#8217;s become nothing of the kind. And even though I have a tough time being around a lot of people for any significant period of time, I sincerely love my family no matter how extended and non-traditional it gets.

On a sidenote, when I looked for &#8220;blended family&#8221; images on [gettyimages.ca](http://www.gettyimages.ca/), they mostly included images of similar-looking people drinking smoothies.
