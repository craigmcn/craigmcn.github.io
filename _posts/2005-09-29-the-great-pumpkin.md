I just have to quickly rave about the [Pumpkin Spice Latte](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/pumpkin-spice-latte) at [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.ca/) &#8230; 8 out of 10 saltines from the Big Cracker! What a nice beverage. While it sounds slightly repulsive, it&#8217;s like drinking a caffeinated pumpkin pie. It&#8217;s delicious! I stopped in at the Starbucks yesterday on my way home from an Ebb gig at [the Rex](http://www.therex.ca/). I picked up a [Maisonneuve](http://www.maisonneuve.org/) magazine and was going to sit and read, but the [Indigo](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/storeLocator/storeDetails/278/) was closing in 10 minutes, so I just went home.

Yay! [Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/) tomorrow!! I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s like being able to watch [Star Wars &#8211; Episode IV](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/): A New Hope when it was first released.
