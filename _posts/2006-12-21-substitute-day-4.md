Hmmm &#8230; not much to say. I&#8217;m about a half-day behind in my lesson plan. (Plan? What plan?) I&#8217;ve been prompting them for more answers to get a feel for how they&#8217;re learning. The problem with some of the material is that there isn&#8217;t a lot to know. Open the application, fill in the blanks and print the report. They don&#8217;t generate a lot of calls, since there&#8217;s not much to them. One thing I did mention is that regardless of the number of calls or the number of times they actually get the call, they&#8217;re still expected to be the experts. We&#8217;ll see. I heard that an earlier training class is pretty much useless even though they&#8217;ve been on the phones with the material for about 6 months.
