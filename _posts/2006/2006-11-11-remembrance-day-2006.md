Even though I&#8217;m on vacation in the alienated West, I still made sure to get out to a <a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/remembrance_day_06-2.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">Remembrance Day ceremony</a>. I met up with A&M in downtown Calgary and we went over to <a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/remembrance_day_06-1.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">the cenotaph</a>. Good ol&#8217; [Ralph Klein](http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/PREMIERS/klein.htm) was there with [Dave Bronconnier](http://www.joindave.com/) to lay wreaths. I was impressed by the extended applause when a wreath was laid on behalf of a Calgary soldier killed in Afghanistan. I felt super bad for the bagpiper and the brass band who were out there in the freezing cold trying to playing frozen instruments with frozen fingers. It was only about -6°C, but it felt way colder.
  
Then we headed over to the [Legion](http://www.legion.ca/) for some beers and managed to catch a pipe band. They were alright, but not really deserving of the inflated praise they received.
