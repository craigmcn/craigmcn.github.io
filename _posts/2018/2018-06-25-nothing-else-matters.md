This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Nothing Else Matters_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_Else_Matters) by [Metallica](http://metallica.com/) from their 1991 album, [Metallica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallica_(album)). The [Vitamin String Quartet](https://www.vitaminstringquartet.com/pages/about-us) version is from their 2001 album, [Say Your Prayers Little One: The String Tribute to Metallica](https://www.vitaminstringquartet.com/collections/albums/products/say-your-prayers-little-one-string-tribute-to-metallica).

I’m going on a Metallica kick for the next couple of installments. I don’t know why, it just seems like something I want to do.
