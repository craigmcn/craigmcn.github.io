This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_West End Girls_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Girls) by [Pet Shop Boys](http://petshopboys.co.uk/) from their 1986 debut album, [Please](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Please_(Pet_Shop_Boys_album)) (it was originaly released as a single in 1984). The GWAR version is from a 2014 episode of [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/search?feature_types=av-undercover).

I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;m much of a GWAR or Pet Shop Boys fan, although I do kind of like Pet Shop Boys&#8217; cover of U2&#8217;s [_Where the Streets Have No Name_](https://youtu.be/Jt2j79pca7c). I was perusing the collection of A.V. Undercover episodes and found GWAR&#8217;s take on the song gave the lyrics more depth. I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d really listened to the lyrics, which are about inner-city (UK) life, and I feel they describe a dystopian and post-apocalyptic landscape that GWAR brings to life. Decide for yourself.
