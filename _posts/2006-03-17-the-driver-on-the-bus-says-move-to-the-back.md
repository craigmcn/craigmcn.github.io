Maybe it&#8217;s just me, or maybe it&#8217;s just people in Toronto, or maybe it happens to everyone all the time, but I have a complaint about people on the bus, and on the subway, and on the streetcar. Is it really necessary for everyone to stand in front of the doors, regardless if they&#8217;re getting off at the next stop? I make a point of being out of the way of the traffic through the bus. But when it&#8217;s my turn to get off the bus, do you think anyone tries to be out of my way? F&#8212;, no!

I think, generally, people are jerks and like it that way.
