[VeeDub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/) might catch the connection of [the title](http://www.amazon.ca/Thirteen-Ways-Sink-Jamie-Gilson/dp/068801304X/sr=1-1/qid=1165524592/ref=sr_1_1/702-6498636-3387213?ie=UTF8&s=books) to my situation, and Wublub&#8217;ll definitely get a kick out of it. I get to be a substitute teacher for a week, starting the week after next. I hope it provides me with enough good times to necessitate a daily update blog. We&#8217;ve got a new bunch of agents coming in to work on the phones supporting my old line of business (_Horizon_, a suite of financial planning tools). The regular trainer is on vacation, so Big Cracker has been asked to step in and kick ass! It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve been actively involved in providing training and even when I was it wasn&#8217;t as formalized as this will be. I just sat in on the current class that finishes tomorrow and it all came flooding back (sadly), so I think I&#8217;m in good shape. Wish me luck! I just hope I don&#8217;t cry.
