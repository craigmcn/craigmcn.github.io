Woo hoo! Super good movie. This is the movie that [Spiderman 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413300/) could have been. We got the character introductions in the last movie, so we didn&#8217;t need anything significant this time around&#8211;and we didn&#8217;t. We got right into the current story: it&#8217;s some time later and things have happened. A new bad guy, sort of, and the return of the other bad guy, sort of. A little plot-twisty to keep us guessing. Not the greatest special effects, but still entertaining.

I didn&#8217;t know much about the [Silver Surfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Surfer) and now I still really don&#8217;t, but he made a good, interesting bad guy.

I&#8217;m a giant fan of [Ioan Gruffudd](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0344435/) (pronounced: _Yo-an Griffith_) and recommend you all watch the [Horatio Hornblower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornblower_(TV_series)) series.

A solid **7 out of 10** saltines. I was really happy with the movie.

Oh, and [Jessica Alba](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004695/) is super-hot!
