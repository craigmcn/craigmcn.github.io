So every morning, heading north, one train goes to St. Clair West station, then the next goes all the way to Downsview. The train going to St. Clair West station is supposed to have &#8220;St. Clair West&#8221; displayed in the front. So I got on the train that displayed &#8220;Downsview&#8221;. But no, that fuckin&#8217; train short-turned at St. Clair West station. Piss me off!
