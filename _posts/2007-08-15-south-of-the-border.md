Woo hoo! Here I am in sunny [Dallas, Texas](http://www.dallascityhall.com/) doing some training on Sharepoint. Leaving the airport Monday afternoon, I found out that the summer motto for [Dallas](http://www.dallascityhall.com/) must be from the [Buster Poindexter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Johansen) tune _[Hot, Hot, Hot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Hot_Hot_%28Arrow%29)_. It is hot here. Really, really hot. I think the temperature at any time of the day is just slightly less than on the surface of the sun. Man, is it ever hot.

And did I mention, it&#8217;s really hot?

Here&#8217;s the four things I know about Dallas:

  1. [Assassination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_assassination) of [John F. Kennedy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy) in Dealey Plaza.
  2. The home of J.R. Ewing and extended family.
  3. &#8220;I been bad, I been good,
  
    Dallas, Texas, Hollywood.&#8221; &#8211; [_Tush_](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/z/zz+top/tush_20149207.html), [ZZ Top](http://www.zztop.com/)
  4. Korben Dallas &#8211; [Bruce Willis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/)&#8216; character in _[The Fifth Element](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119116/)_

Maybe I&#8217;ll learn more over the next few days.
