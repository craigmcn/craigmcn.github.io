So, I definitely feel a little more important after the comments from Gwildor and K. Thanks. And, sorry K, that beef really had a funny smell to it.

Had a huge headache by the time work was done today &#8230; I don&#8217;t know how these people can get their own shoes tied, let alone do their jobs. It was busy, so I didn&#8217;t get a chance to work on a couple of [ASP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) projects I wanted to work on. One of them, I&#8217;m still not quite sure why I agreed to do it &#8230; I created a small addition to our departmental intranet site to make some information available that was orginally emailed on a weekly basis. I thought it would be easier, rather than sort out a bunch of emails, people could just &#8220;go online&#8221; and get the info. Well, someone whined about needing the information emailed, so I agreed to build a way for the email to send automatically each week. I&#8217;m still working on it, but I&#8217;m not sure why. The information is right there for anyone to see, why does it need to be emailed? Whatever.

Anyway, I hoped to get the logon stuff implemented over the weekend &#8230; no good. I barely even looked at it, I got all hung up on getting a live news feed from <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news" target="_blank">CBC.ca</a>. I&#8217;m almost set for the <a href="http://www.cfl.ca" target="_blank">CFL</a> stats to be added &#8230; I&#8217;m just working on the daily feed, rather than a live feed that slows the loading of the page. I did get the grid worked out for the Settlers of Catan online game &#8230; I&#8217;m just waiting to get the final positioning on the page before I assign coordinates.

I was all excited about loading <a href="http://www.callofduty.com/" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a> on the new PC &#8230; got everything loaded &#8230; Woo Hoo! Except it kept crashing with wierd graphics accelerator errors. I thought the first was a fluke, so I rebooted and retried &#8230; how do you write a raspberry? maybe [ZRBTT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znDI9UpFYKE) &#8230; Anyway, so I google up &#8216;Call of Duty&#8217; and &#8216;Radeon 9600&#8217;. What do I get &#8230; yeah, Call of Duty and Radeon video adapters don&#8217;t completely like each other. So I have to load SP4 for Win2K, then the new display driver and TaDa! Works like a charm &#8230; and surprisingly, <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/hitman-contracts/" target="_blank">Hitman: Contracts</a> still works!!
