Is it like this with everyone who owns a home? Every time I look around, there&#8217;s some new project that needs to get done.

  * a window seat that needs rebuilding
  * some built-in shelves that needs rebuilding
  * outlets re-wired
  * bathroom needs a shower installed
  * bathroom needs renovating
  * natural gas line fitted to barbecue (and probably a new barbecue!)
  * programmable thermostat installed (and should take, like, 4 minutes!)

But, man, that&#8217;s a lot of stuff! Why did I buy this house?
