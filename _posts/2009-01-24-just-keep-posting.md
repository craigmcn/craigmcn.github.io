I figured I had better keep up my posting streak, so here’s something posted.

It’s Saturday and I didn’t really do much beyond buying my groceries, but I happened to stop by the [Paddock Wood](http://www.paddockwood.com/) brewery (yes, the website needs work, maybe I’ll offer my services); my dad was returning his bottles and picking up some new brews. They make bunch of super beers; some I know from first-hand, delicious experience, others from second-hand, mouth-watering experience. I realized that they have at least 3 kinds that sound super that I have to try: Vienna Red, London Porter and the Winter Ale. I’m sure there’s more, but we’ll start there!
