It took me a few days to decide that I wanted to write this. It’s a little off-colour, but in the end it should be a little funny.

I was at my Dad&#8217;s for dinner Sunday, as usual, and he served asparagus, as he often does. But this time was slightly different: when I went pee after dinner, as I often do, it smelled. Just a few minutes after eating. And again later that night.

I don&#8217;t recall ever having smelly pee from asparagus, sometimes from coffee, but not from pee. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asparagus#Urine_effects) tells me that this is entirely normal, including the rapid onset of the smell. So I&#8217;m alright with that.

Are there any other good smelly pee stories out there?
