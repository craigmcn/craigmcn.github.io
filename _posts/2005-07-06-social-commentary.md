Another tidbit of social commentary that was part of a communication at work. We recently had a food drive for the [Daily Bread food bank](http://www.dailybread.ca/). Here&#8217;s a quote from their website:

&#8220;**How would you survive on this income?** In 2004 the Median Annual Income of food bank households is **$11,160**. In 2001 the Median Annual Income for a Toronto household was **$49,345**. After food bank clients have paid their ever-increasing rents and utilities they have, on average, **$4.26 per day** to buy everything else they need.&#8221;

As part of my commentary about [Live 8](http://www.live8live.com/) and the [Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/) campaign, I support making poverty history. Charity begins at home.
