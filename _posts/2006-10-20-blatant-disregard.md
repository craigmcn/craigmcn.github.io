I couldn&#8217;t believe the [_cojones_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cojones) on the two dudes in the subway selling obviously [pirated](http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_views/what_is_piracy.html) DVDs. I went shopping on my way home after work and since I was headed to [College and Spadina](http://www.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=college+and+spadina+toronto&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=43.658092,-79.400167&spn=0.015151,0.054245&om=1), I took the subway to Spadina station, then took the streetcar south.

For those of you unfamiliar with [the TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/), transferring from the north-south University-Spadina line to the east-west Bloor-Danforth line (or to the streetcars) at Spadina station means walking down a super-long hallway. The hallway used to have moving sidewalks (Ã  la 1980s). But the sidewalks kept breaking down, so they were removed. This leaves a super-wide, super-long hallway.

Sometimes there&#8217;s [buskers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busker), but today there were two dudes selling DVDs. Not a bad place to do it, except even buskers need a licence from the TTC to do their thing, and guaranteed these dudes did not have a licence. I say this because they were selling DVDs of [Jackass 2](http://www.jackassmovie.com/), [Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420294/) and [The Grudge 2](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/thegrudge2/site/noflash.php). (I think there were others, but those are the ones I noticed.) All of these movies are still in theatres. Hmm, yet also out on DVD? Not likely in any legal format! It&#8217;s lucky there wasn&#8217;t an off-duty cop wandering through, or the [Transit Police](http://www3.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/Safety_and_Security/Transit_Enforcement_Unit.jsp).
