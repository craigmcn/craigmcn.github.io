When I was in Toronto last week for some much-needed rest and relaxation, I popped into the bookstore where my good buddy works. I was wearing my _Blue Rodeo 25 Years_ t-shirt. My buddy, clearly joking, asked, &#8220;Oh, Blue Rodeo? I&#8217;ve never heard of them. Tell me a little about them.&#8221; Before I could say anything much, one of the other staff members said, &#8220;Oh, yeah, _Hook,_ that&#8217;s one of theirs.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know this guy, so I didn&#8217;t know if he was [taking the piss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taking_the_piss); I&#8217;m thinking, &#8220;Umm, that&#8217;s Blues Traveler. Does he know that?&#8221; But almost right away he says, &#8220;Oh, no, that&#8217;s Blues Traveler.&#8221; I still don&#8217;t know if he was kidding, but if I had, I would&#8217;ve found it pretty damn funny.

In honour of this rather amusing situation, this week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Blues Traveler](http://bluestraveler.com/)&#8216;s 1995 classic, _[Hook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(Blues*Traveler_song)),* from their widely popular album, [Four](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_(Blues_Traveler_album)>). There&#8217;s no cover here, except maybe [this lip sync battle](http://youtu.be/bLBSoC_2IY8?t=1m56s). For comparison, the second track is [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/)&#8216;s single, _Better Off As We Are,_ which was released around the same time as *Hook*.
