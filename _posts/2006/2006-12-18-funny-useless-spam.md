So I got a spam post to my blog. It&#8217;s on a [blog from June 2005](/slightly-maligned.html). Obviously I need to check my spam catcher, but I&#8217;m wondering how the spam bot found that particular post. There&#8217;s no other comments and the content isn&#8217;t such that anyone else would link to it. What a useless piece of spam.
