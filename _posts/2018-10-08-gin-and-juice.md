This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Gin and Juice_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_and_Juice) by
[Snoop Doggy Dogg](http://snoopdogg.com/) from his 1993 album,
[Doggystyle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggystyle). [The Gourds](http://www.thegourds.com/)
version is probably from their 2001 album, Shinebox, but possibly recorded earlier.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gourds#Career):
> Despite a sizable amount of original material, The Gourds are probably best known for a song they did not write, and for which they initially did not receive credit. A recording of the band’s cover of Snoop Dogg’s “Gin and Juice” was widely shared on the popular file-sharing site Napster, with the song miscredited to the band [Phish](http://phish.com/).
