excerpt: I first heard Petunia and the Vipers a couple of months ago on cbcmusic.ca on the Alternative Country channel and needed to see them live. I found the video for Yes Baby Yes (Cold Heartbreaker) on YouTube and loved it!

Man! I had the best time at the [Petunia and the Vipers](http://www.petuniaandthevipers.com/all-albums/) show Thursday night! What a great band. I was about to say original. Channelling Wilf Carter and Hank Williams Sr. may not be original, but it&#8217;s friggin&#8217; awesome.

I first heard them a couple of months ago on [cbcmusic.ca](http://music.cbc.ca/#/genres/Country) on the Alternative Country channel and needed to see them live. I was super lucky to find out they were going to play Lydia&#8217;s within a few weeks.

I found the video for _[Yes Baby Yes (Cold Heartbreaker)](http://youtu.be/xwYMSGc-fEA)_ on YouTube and loved it! And last night they sang a 100-year-old song (_[Ragtime Cowboy Joe](http://youtu.be/XChupTtkIII)_) that I think I&#8217;m going to try writing a short story about.

Petunia has this great kazoo that&#8217;s attached by electrical tape to what seems to be the end of a bicycle horn, which acts like a trumpet bell. You&#8217;ll hear it at the beginning of Yes Baby Yes, after the yodelling—amazing.

9 out of 10 saltines. These guys are a lot of fun. And the main guy&#8217;s name&#8217;s Petunia. Weird&#8230; and cool.
