Wow! It&#8217;s been well over a month since the last post. And the last 6 that appear in the home page date back into March—pretty sad.

Now that it&#8217;s official at work, I&#8217;ll let you in on my secret: I&#8217;m moving to [Saskatoon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/)! I know some of you are sad (like I am, slightly) and some of you are happy (like I am, mostly). I bought a house with my sister, so now I&#8217;ll have my niece to play [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_II) with me, oh and a place to live. I don&#8217;t have a job yet, but given the cooking economy in [Saskatchewan](http://www.sasktourism.com/) I&#8217;ll be fine.

Well, I don&#8217;t really mean the “cooking” economy, it&#8217;s not like I plan to be a chef. I mean that the economy is strong and growing. How that translates to cooking I&#8217;m not sure, but it&#8217;s a common colloquialism that expected you to understand. Anywho, the economy&#8217;s good, so I&#8217;ll [prosper](http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Vulcan_salute), I&#8217;m sure.

I think I may just find something part-time or evenings and weekends while I look for what I actually want and build up my web development and technical writing portfolio. Hey, whatever, we&#8217;ll see what happens.
