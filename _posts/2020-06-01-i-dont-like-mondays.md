This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_I Don’t Like Mondays_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Like_Mondays) by
[The Boomtown Rats](http://www.boomtownrats.co.uk/) from their 1979 album,
[The Fine Art of Surfacing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fine_Art_of_Surfacing). The [Tori Amos](http://toriamos.com/)
version is from her 2001 album, [Strange Little Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Little_Girls).

My partner was singing this song this morning. When I looked into it, it seemed like an appropriately dark song for the times.
