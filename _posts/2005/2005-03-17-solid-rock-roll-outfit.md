So, I like [Nickelback](http://www.nickelback.com/). I think they&#8217;re a solid rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll outfit. But I&#8217;m always open to some other opinions. h! sent me a link to a pretty funny comparison of 2 Nickelback tunes: <del>www.thewebshite.net/nickelback.htm</del><http://tindeck.com/listen/doel>. You&#8217;ll need your sound for this. My buddy Nelson didn&#8217;t have anything positive to say about Nickelback&#8217;s music, but he did accept that they were good businessmen, in that they make a ton of money!
