Feeling a little down right now, so this week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Adele](http://adele.tv/)&#8216;s [_Someone Like You_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someone_like_You_(Adele_song)) from her [second album, 21](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(Adele_album)), released in 2011. There&#8217;s no cover version, but here&#8217;s a link to a pretty funny [Saturday Night Live](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live_(season_37)#Episodes) sketch [that centers on the song](https://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=10150409637677958).
