This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_We Got the Beat_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Got_the_Beat) by [The Go-Go&#8217;s](http://www.gogos.com/) from their 1981 album, [Beauty and the Beat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beat_(The_Go-Go%27s_album)). [The Coathangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coathangers) version is from a 2014 episode of [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/search?feature_types=av-undercover).

I&#8217;ve liked the Go-go&#8217;s since I was a kid, and Beauty and the Beat is classic. I&#8217;m loving the [A.V. Club](http://www.avclub.com/) Undercover series that I found with [the last Music Monday post](http://craigmcn.ca/the-final-countdown.html). They have a couple other great covers, so I&#8217;ll probably be sharing those over the next couple of weeks.
