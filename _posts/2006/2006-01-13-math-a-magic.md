So, I&#8217;m a huge fan of math and its intricacies. It touches my heart to [read about people using math](http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=173864&cid=14462682) in smart ways. Sure, it cost a guy his job, and supposedly now the work can be done more cheaply (although I expect the sub-contractor will just take home more money), but I wonder why the guy hadn&#8217;t figured it out earlier.
