This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Feeling Good_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good) by [Nina Simone](http://www.ninasimone.com/) from her 1965 album, [I Put a Spell on You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Put_a_Spell_on_You_(album)). The [Michael Bublé](http://michaelbuble.com/) version is from his 2005 album, [It’s Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Time_(Michael_Bubl%E9_album)).

This song was performed at a high school graduation banquet I attended recently, and I quite enjoyed the song and the banquet.
