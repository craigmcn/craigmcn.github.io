This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Sunday Morning Coming Down_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Mornin%27_Comin%27_Down) by [Kris Kristofferson](http://www.kriskristofferson.com/), written in 1969. Because [Johnny Cash](http://johnnycash.com/) won a 1970 Country Music Association award for his recording, I thought it appropriate to use a clip from the Johnny Cash Show, with Cash and Kristofferson doing a duet. For whatever reason, I was always under the impression the song was Cash&#8217;s.

The [Shawn Mullins](http://www.shawnmullins.com/) version is from his 1998 album, [Soul&#8217;s Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul%27s_Core). I bought the Shawn Mullins album after _[Lullaby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lullaby_(Shawn_Mullins_song))_Â became a big hit, and I was really impressed with the whole album. Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t paid much attention to him since.
