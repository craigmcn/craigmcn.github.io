This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Crazy in Love_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_in_Love) by [Beyoncé](http://beyonce.com/) from her 2003 debut solo album, [Dangerously in Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerously_in_Love). The [Scott Richmond](http://scottrichmondmusic.com/) version is from a 2014 performance at [the Artesian](http://www.artesianon13th.ca/).

My thanks to a good friend for turning me onto Scott Richmond and sharing this cover with me. I&#8217;m not suggesting that I&#8217;m currently crazy in love, please don&#8217;t make that conclusion.
