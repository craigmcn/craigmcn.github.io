I love scientific research, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but do we really need [new elements on the periodic table](http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/06/11/unnamed-element-periodic-table.html)? Is this where scientific research funding should really be going? I mean, how useful can an element be if it only exists for a split second?

In my humble opinion, I don&#8217;t believe we know enough about what&#8217;s going on here on Earth right now, without creating new things about whose effects we know nothing. It irks me a little to imagine how much time, money and effort goes into this kind of research, when we still barely understand the current climate change issues, can barely manage our own economies and cannot substantially help emerging economies and nations.
