[National Punctuation Day](http://www.nationalpunctuationday.com/) was Saturday, so I’m pretty late with this post. Sorry. But, hey, who doesn’t love punctuation?

In honour of [National Punctuation Day](http://www.nationalpunctuationday.com/), I’m offering you some links to some great grammar and punctuation information.

  * [How to Use an Apostrophe](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apostrophe)
  * [When to Use i.e. in a Sentence](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/ie)
  * [How to Use a Semicolon](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon)

And not so grammar-related, but pretty good language-use items:

  * [What It Means When You Say Literally](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally)
  * [Ten Words You Need to Stop Misspelling](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/misspelling)

I hope you can learn something with these and have a good time!
