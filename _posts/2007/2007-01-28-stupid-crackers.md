I don&#8217;t know how many of you are familiar with the mechanics of bagpipes, so let me tell you. There&#8217;s [a chanter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes#Chanter) with a [double reed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_reed), that&#8217;s where the fingers go to play the melody. Then there&#8217;s three [drones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes#Drone) with [single reeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_%28music%29#Single_reeds) for the sustained harmony. Finally there&#8217;s [the bag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes#Bag).

As you might notice from my description, the reeds are fairly important parts of the instrument, since they&#8217;re the parts that actually make the noise. Every now and again, the reeds require some adjustment to make them sound, or to keep them sounding, their best. The other day Big Cracker took the reeds out to make some adjustments. However, the stupid ass didn&#8217;t remember to put them back in before he took the 45-minute [streetcar](http://world.nycsubway.org/canada/toronto/streetcar-intro.html) journey down to his rehearsal space. Needless to say the ol&#8217; pipes were fairly quiet today.
