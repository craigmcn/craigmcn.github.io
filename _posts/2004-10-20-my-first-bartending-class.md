Oh yeah! Big Cracker can free pour you a whole ton of drinks with vodka in them! Sometimes mixing them up with Tequila, instead. You like Black Russians (Vodka with Kahlua)? Well, maybe try a Black Mexican, also known as a Black Bull (Tequila with Kahlua). Maybe you like a simple Screwdriver (Vodka with Orange Juice), why not mix it up a bit and have a Harvey Wallbanger (Vodka with Orange Juice and Galliano)? Or try Harvey&#8217;s southern cousin, Freddy Fudpucker (Tequila with Orange Juice and Galliano). All of those would be served over ice in a highball glass. Woo Hoo! Good Times!

If you didn&#8217;t guess already, I had my first <a href="http://www.bartendingontario.com" target="_blank">bartending class</a> last night. I had a really good time. I was surprised that it&#8217;s mostly women. There&#8217;s 3 dudes in a class of 13. We had to tell everyone who we were and why we were there&#8230; One girl&#8217;s whole reason: &#8220;I&#8217;m a student, I&#8217;m a mother, and I&#8217;m broke.&#8221; &#8230; &#8216;Nuff said! So, there&#8217;s a variety of people in my class&#8230; poor Shirley barely speaks English, but she&#8217;s getting through&#8230; Agnieska, Aggie for short, is a day care worker looking to do something different&#8230; most of the other people are &#8216;between jobs&#8217;.

What does that mean, &#8216;between jobs&#8217;? I was between jobs once, I called it unemployed. It was the time after I quit one job and was looking for another &#8230; again, unemployed. I guess if you generally do contract work and you have contracts that leave a gap, you&#8217;d be between jobs &#8230; But does this happen with a lot of people? Hmmmm &#8230; I don&#8217;t think so.

**Update several hours later &#8230;** I finished my quick-and-dirty dBase manager. It works as well as I want it to and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll upgrade it a bit over time &#8230; But at least the Puzzles are corrected now.

And &#8230; Way to go Roughriders!! Saskatchewan is now 2nd in the West &#8230; Only 4 points (2 wins) behind B.C. Too bad we can only make up 1 game &#8230; even if B.C. loses their next 2 games &#8230; Against Calgary and Saskatchewan.
