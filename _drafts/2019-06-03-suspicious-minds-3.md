This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Suspicious Minds_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicious_Minds) by
[Elvis Presley](http://elvis.com/) from his 1969 single. The [Fine Young Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Young_Cannibals)
version is from their 1985 debut album, [Fine Young Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Young_Cannibals_(album)).

In the past, I’ve failed to note that this song was “first recorded by American songwriter Mark James. The song was recorded by Elvis Presley with producer Chips Moman after James’ recording failed commercially, becoming a number one song [for Presley] in 1969”.
