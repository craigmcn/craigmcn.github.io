excerpt: I put in an ad alerting the community to two free lawnmowers beside my garage. Before I left for work the next morning, the electric was gone. By the time I got home from work, the reel mower was gone. Amazing.

I had these two lawnmowers, an electric and a reel mower, that weren&#8217;t pulling their weight. The electric was actually alright, but blew the circuit breaker every other time I used it. The reel mower didn&#8217;t even turn; I&#8217;m not sure what was wrong, but it obviously needed work that I wasn&#8217;t going to do.

I had them out of the shed and in the back lane beside the garage when J came over to grab a truckload of stuff to go to the dump. _Sorry, the Saskatoon Regional Waste Management Centre._ He mentioned that our mutual acquaintance, Jonny, used [freecycle.org](http://www.freecycle.org/) to get rid of stuff just by putting in an ad saying that there&#8217;s free stuff in the alley.

I checked in with Jonny who said that he had better luck with the [free stuff section](http://saskatoon.kijiji.ca/f-Classifieds-W0QQAdTypeZ2QQPriceAlternativeZ3) of [Kijiji](http://saskatoon.kijiji.ca/). In fact, he said that he&#8217;d once used it successfully to trade an unopened package of razor blades to the first person who brought him a Tim Hortons&#8217; extra-large double-double.

So at about 8:30 pm, I put in an ad alerting the community to two free lawnmowers beside my garage. Before I left for work the next morning, the electric was gone. By the time I got home from work, the reel mower was gone. Amazing.

People love free stuff!
