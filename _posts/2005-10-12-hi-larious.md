That [My Name is Earl](http://www.tv.com/shows/my-name-is-earl/) show is the funniest thing I&#8217;ve seen in ages! Sure, [Corner Gas](http://www.cornergas.com/) was funny for the first season and into the second, but I think it&#8217;s lost some of its appeal. Although I admit that _Earl_ may go the same way. The real problem with creating a funny, quirky show like _Corner Gas_ or _Earl_is keeping it funny. Except it&#8217;s usually not enough to keep it funny, you need to keep making it funnier. Whether you can last 9 seasons ([Seinfeld](http://www.tv.com/shows/seinfeld/)), 10 seasons ([Friends](http://www2.warnerbros.com/friendstv/index.html)&#8230;Â actually maybe they lasted longer) or only 2 seasons, I think it&#8217;s important to get out before you&#8217;re absolutely not funny ([Frasier](http://www.tv.com/shows/frasier/)).

And for all you hockey fans out there &#8230; oh yeah, you know who you are &#8230; the stats are up on the right!!
