**WOO HOO!**

For those of who aren&#8217;t keeping up &#8230; I&#8217;ve moved. And since you&#8217;re seeing a blog today, it means my computers are set up!! Yay! It&#8217;s not quite the desk set up I was hoping for, the wall space is a little narrower than I had anticipated. But the storage stuff is (mostly) in storage (I&#8217;ve found a few things that still need to be moved in.), and the apartment stuff is in the apartment. And **HUGE** thanks to <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and Trikie for helping me move &#8230; even though my desk chair and vacuum cleaner are still in their van.

That&#8217;s the update for today &#8230; stay tuned for the exciting news of the rest of the unpacking!
