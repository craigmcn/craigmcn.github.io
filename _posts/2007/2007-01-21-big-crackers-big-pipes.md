Thanks to [Big Tim](http://ppfhouse.com/music/timshia/), I&#8217;ve got a cool space where I can play my [bagpipes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes). It&#8217;s the first time in about 10 years that I&#8217;ve had a regular place to practice. I spent a solid hour playing and my hands, arms and back are sore, not mention that I&#8217;m completely winded. Thanks, Timbo!
