Hi there, boys and girls! Wublub&#8217;s recent post <em style="font-size: 0.8em;">(2012-08-12: Wublub&#8217;s website has since been removed)</em> spurred me to post something. Not because I feel that &#8220;Facebook killed my website&#8221;, but because I realized that it&#8217;s been far too long since I posted anything.

I realized that I failed to mention my 2-week vacation to [Saskatoon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/). It was very relaxing and enjoyable. Although I spent perhaps too much time drinking beer at the [Yard and Flagon](http://www.yardandflagon.ca/home)—those hot wings ripped my lips off! I managed to see some old friends and make some new ones. Good times!

I also realized that I have barely mentioned my new job as a web publisher. It&#8217;s a really good job and exactly what I need right now. I&#8217;m a little frustrated by the silly policies that are enforced, since it makes me less productive. For example, since I ride the [TTC](http://www.ttc.ca/) to work, I have to allow for delays, which means that sometimes I&#8217;m noticeably early for work. But I&#8217;ve been informed that I have to stay until 5:00 pm in order to provide the appropriate _coverage_. But since no one&#8217;s going to agree to pay me overtime when I show up before 9:00 am, I won&#8217;t bother. I&#8217;ll sit on the couches in the concourse and read.

I&#8217;ve also been highly pre-occupied with Harry Potter. Since I finished the one book I was reading when I was in Saskatoon, I picked up [Harry Potter 1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_4/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=399204&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186) (from Daddy-O&#8217;s bookshelf). I finished it. They didn&#8217;t have [HP2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_5/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=399188&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186), so I read [HP3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_6/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=537640&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186). I finished it the day I came home. I don&#8217;t have [HP4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_7/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=567987&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186), so I moved onto [HP5](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_8/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=567986&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186), which was timely, since the new movie&#8217;s just come out. I&#8217;ve now moved onto [HP6](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=amb_link_1403372_9/002-7877061-8388018?ie=UTF8&docId=570956&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=browse&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=289712901&pf_rd_i=1084186) and should be finished in time for [HP7](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0545010225/ref=amb_link_5126492_1/002-7877061-8388018?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=0YZE44NZKH6BYFSP97KF&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=298835901&pf_rd_i=1084186), when it gets delivered to my home Saturday. It&#8217;s been a real thrill-ride adventure!

Other than that? Well, I&#8217;ve had to put my [Dungeons & Dragons](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/welcome) schedule on hold, since I have [an online class](http://calendardb.humber.ca/LIS/WebCalendar/CE/ProgramOffering.do?name=08381) I&#8217;m taking on Tuesdays. And I&#8217;ve got a ridiculously large number of movies I need see: <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449088/">Pirates 3</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337978/">Die Hard 4</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/">Transformers 1</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0496806/">Ocean&#8217;s 3</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0373889/">Harry Potter 5</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450385/">1408</a>.</span>
