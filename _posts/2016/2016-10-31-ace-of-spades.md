This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Ace of Spades_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Spades_(song)) by [Motörhead](http://imotorhead.com/) from their 1980 album, [Ace of Spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_of_Spades_(album)). The [Lisa LeBlanc](http://www.lisaleblanc.ca/en/) version is from her 2016 performance on [CBC Music&#8217;s First Play Live](http://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/14532/lisa-leblanc-why-you-wanna-leave-runaway-queen-fpl).

This just came up in my Facebook feed. I think it&#8217;s a good Hallowe&#8217;en tune. Although I suppose maybe _Thriller_ would be more appropriate.
