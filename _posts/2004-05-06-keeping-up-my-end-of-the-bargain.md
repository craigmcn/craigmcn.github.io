Alrighty, so the whiny idiots at work &#8230; oh, sorry, those are callers, I mean, _my colleagues_ at work are somehow entertained by these blogs and are feeling some kind of loss at my infrequent posts. Granted, it&#8217;s been a week since I lasted blogged, but let me draw your attention to Wublub &#8230; yeah, so he posted yesterday, but it was more than a week between posts. And, okay, even my [April 22 post](/good-stuff-coming-up.html) mentioned that blogs are &#8220;usually short, frequently updated posts&#8221;, and obviously I haven&#8217;t been keeping up my end of the bargain &#8230; Is there a bargain here? Or as I always love: bar-goon.

Well, the last episode of <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/friends/" target="_blank">Friends</a> was tonight &#8230; who got weepy-eyed? Admit it, I know you guys. Actually, if anything got the crocodile tears flowing, it was Carter and Makemba (Kim) losing their baby on <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/er/" target="_blank">ER</a>. Boy, that sucked ass.

So, what&#8217;s up for the next little while? I know you&#8217;re on the edge of your seats. Well, I was thinking about becoming a beta tester for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online" target="_blank">The Matrix Online</a>, but my video card doesn&#8217;t pass muster for minimum system requirements. Other than that, I&#8217;m going to be working on trying to get these pages to load faster. I&#8217;m not quite sure what takes so long, but I&#8217;ll try some things and see what happens.
