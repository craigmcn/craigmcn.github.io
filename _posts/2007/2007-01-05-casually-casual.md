I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night, because I had laundry to do. I know, you&#8217;re thinking, &#8220;Dude, you have a washer and dryer in your apartment. How could doing laundry cause you to lose sleep?&#8221; Well, it has to do with casual day at work. [I mentioned a while ago](/dress-like-a-slob.html) that I prefer to dress very casually, so it&#8217;s important to me to make the most of casual days at work. I was planning on doing a quick load of whites last night, knowing it would take &#8217;til bedtime for the not-so-hot dryer to get the clothes to the point where I canÂ move them onto the drying rack, thus conserving power. Halfway through loading the washer, with a goodly pile of whites wet and soapy, I noticed that all the jeans were in the laundry pile. Crappy. So I let the washer do it&#8217;s thing with the whites, then threw them into the dryer while I did a load of darks, including the jeans. When the washer was finished, I removed the whites from the dryer and put the jeans in. Just the jeans, to ensure they&#8217;d be dry! But they weren&#8217;t dry until well after bedtime and needing me to wake up in the middle of the night to fire up the dryer again. So, just to make sure I had jeans to wear on casual day, I lost a fair amount of sleep, restlessly tossing and turning, making sure the dryer was still going as long as the jeans were still wet. The lengths I go to &#8230;.
