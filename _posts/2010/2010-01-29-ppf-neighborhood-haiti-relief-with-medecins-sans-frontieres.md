Hey Friends, I was up until one o&#8217;clock this morning finishing my part of this project, I hope you check it out and help out a great cause, and some terrific artists!

In an effort to bring aid to those suffering in Haiti, over 2 dozen like-minded friends in the independent arts community, many based in Toronto, and a few from abroad, have banded together to put together the PPF Neighborhood: a downloadable benefit compilation of music, visual art and photographs.

The project is a third party fundraiser for Médecins Sans Frontières (aka Doctors Without Borders) and all proceeds will go to assist MSF’s work with the victims of the earthquake.  What we hope is that, even if you’ve given already, you’ll feel compelled to donate $5 (or more if you want) to help us make a difference in a tragic situation.  In return you will receive 14 tracks of original music and 13 works of visual art and photography, packaged neatly in a pdf booklet.

Just go to [ppfhouse.bandcamp.com](http://ppfhouse.bandcamp.com) where you can purchase the album through paypal or any major credit card.

Featuring a who’s who of award winning artists, the project brings together Juno Award Winners (and losers), U of T Art Professors, Underground Hip Hoppers, Latin Jazzers, Pop and Electronica Darlings, as well as Vanguards of Illustration, Animation and Photography.  It’s an eclectic mix of “creative” types who are trying to use what they do best to offer a helping hand.

Thanks for your support and please feel free to let any and all know about the project.
  
The PPF House Neighborhood will only be available until Feb.11, 2010, the final day before the Canadian Government closes its pledge to match all private donations.
