While I disagree with the Saskatchewan government’s decision to eliminate the film employment tax credit, I also disagree with the disagreement of the budget cut. If the Saskatchewan government no longer wants the film and television industry in Saskatchewan, then, unfortunately, it means that it’s time for those folks to move on.

Saskatchewan only weathered the current economic downturn through sheer luck. Certainly not through any spectacular decision-making by the government. Seriously, a government willing to spend [$10 million on wheat research](http://www2.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/business/story.html?id=0bf28f38-59d6-4eee-b9b9-01105e90963a "Sask. sets $10M for wheat research"), but not $8 million on film, video and television isn’t exactly forward-thinking.

Premier Brad Wall said that he is willing to look at alternative ways to support the province’s film and video industry, but I would expect that support would be best provided in an $8-million-per-year tax credit.

This is the government we voted for.
