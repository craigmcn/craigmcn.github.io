I know you guys were getting tired of always seeing [Melissa Auf Der Maur](http://www.aufdermaur.com/) in the Now Playing section of my page, but she&#8217;s back. This time it&#8217;s in the form of [Hand of Doom](http://www.last.fm/music/Auf+Der+Maur/Hand+Of+Doom), her [Black Sabbath](http://www.black-sabbath.com/) tribute, [Live in Los Angeles](http://www.amazon.com/Live-Los-Angeles-Hand-Doom/dp/B00006FSUI)! I caught them at Edgefest a few years ago and have been trying to track down an album ever since. Thanks to [Smokey](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) pushing [last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) and Cyon pushing [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/), I found the CD. Now it&#8217;s Sabbath covers for the next long while! Mind you Melissa is no [Shirley Manson](http://shirley-manson.org/), but I wouldn&#8217;t kick &#8216;er outta bed for eatin&#8217; crackers.
