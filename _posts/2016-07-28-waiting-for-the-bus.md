I once mentioned that [this blog is for complaining](this-blog-is-now-about-complaining.html). Here&#8217;s today&#8217;s complaint.

I see you waiting for the bus. You get on the bus and then you have to search through your bag for your wallet and then extract your bus pass or ticket or change. What the hell were you waiting for? Why not take some time while you&#8217;re waiting for the bus to search through your junk for the thing you need to get on the bus? I get it if you had to run for the bus, and sometimes I see that you&#8217;re checking your pockets because the thing you need is not where it ought to be. But there are way too many instances where you seem content to hold up the queue rather than prepare just a little bit. Come on!
