[<img style="margin-right: 1em;" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8133385/images/the-baron.jpg" alt="The Baron, napping, at Xmas time." width="300" align="left" />](http://yfrog.com/gy43704649j)Today’s post is just a little bit of housekeeping. I was advised that I maybe use too many kitty cats in my posts, so I will try to use more puppy dogs. In fact this first one is my own, well, my sister’s, puppy dog, The Baron, having a little nap at Xmas time.

The other thing that was mentioned to me is that people are perhaps concerned about having a discussion with me, for fear that it will end up here, on the internet. They’re not entirely wrong. I have, in fact, always been interested in [this shirt](http://store.northshoreshirts.com/imbltht.html "I'm blogging this"), because, in fact, I probably am blogging this.

Now, I would have to say that if I have a disagreement with you and it ends up online, you should have known it was going to happen. I’m almost positive that if we have a disagreement, you know about it, and nothing that ends up in this blog is a surprise.
