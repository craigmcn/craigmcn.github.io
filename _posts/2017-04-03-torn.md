This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Torn_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torn_(Ednaswap_song)) by [Ednaswap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ednaswap) from their 1995 album, [Ednaswap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ednaswap_(album)). The [Natalie Imbruglia](http://www.natalieimbruglia.com/) version is from their 1997 album, [Left of the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_of_the_Middle).

This is another one from the &#8220;covers you didn’t know were covers&#8221; [video](https://youtu.be/JGFlD2pbn00). I also didn’t know it was a cover. The description from the Ednaswap video would suggest that the song was &#8220;taken from them&#8221;. I don’t know the details, but I would suggest they should have done a better job with it.
