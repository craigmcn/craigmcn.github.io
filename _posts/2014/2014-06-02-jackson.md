It seems I have [Johnny Cash](http://johnnycash.com/) on my mind. Well, usually only when it&#8217;s not [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/). This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [Jackson,](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_(song)>) as performed by Johnny Cash and [June Carter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Carter) sometime in 1967. While it was written by [Billy Edd Wheeler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Edd_Wheeler) and [Jerry Leiber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Leiber) ,and a hit for [Nancy Sinatra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Sinatra) and [Lee Hazlewood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hazlewood), my favourite version is this country version. And I like the silly, variety show intro.

You can always check out some of Nancy Sinatra&#8217;s work in an [older Music Monday post](http://craigmcn.ca/music-monday-bang-bang-my-baby-shot-me-down.html 'Music Monday: Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)').
