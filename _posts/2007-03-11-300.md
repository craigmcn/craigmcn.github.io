Word to the wise, back is better. That is, sit farther back from the screen when viewing a movie in [IMAX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX). As well, show up earlier, in order to get a seat nearer the back.

That said, Gwildor, JAC and I went out to see [300](http://300themovie.warnerbros.com/) at the [IMAX](http://www.bigmoviezone.com/filmsearch/movies/index.html?uniq=518) yesterday. Wicked! I know Gwildor rated it 5 out of 5 Gs, and I can understand why. The action and effects were spectacular. While I thought the [bullet time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_time) was a little excessive, Gwildor liked it, since there was usually a secondary action sequence in the background that would have otherwise been missed. As well, the story was good, giving us a highly entertaining history lesson. However, I&#8217;m curious to know how historically accurate the story was, because the [Persians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Empire), especially [Xerxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I), are made out to be larger-than-life. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just the result of 2500 years of historical revision (and [artistic licence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_licence)). For the dudes, there&#8217;s lots of blood, body parts are hacked off and bodies are piled up as defensive berms, plus there&#8217;s nipples. For the ladies, 300 mostly nude, incredibly buff dudes.

Good times! 9 out 10 saltines (I think I&#8217;ve mentioned that nothing gets a 10.)
