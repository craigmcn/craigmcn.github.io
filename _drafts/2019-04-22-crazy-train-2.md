This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Crazy Train_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Train) by
[Ozzy Osbourne](http://ozzy.com/) from their 1980 album,
[Blizzard of Ozz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_of_Ozz). The [The Gravel Spreaders](http://www.thegravelspreaders.com/)
version is from their 2012 album, [COVER ALBUM](http://example.com).

In putting this one together, I found out that the other [Crazy Train](/crazy-train.html) cover I posted is also bluegrass.
