Okay, so even though nobody actually cares, I&#8217;ve released crackerMail v2.0 in its final state. Based on some input from an Eastern European user, I may build a function to work with the [ISO-8859-2 character set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-2). The user sent me an e-mail and his name includes a <small>ć</small>. Of course crackerMail couldn&#8217;t interpret the character and dumped some ugly translation code on the screen instead. I had already resolved the issue with the [ISO-8859-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1) character set after getting an e-mail from a Scandinavian user with ø in his name. Anyway, long story short, crackerMail&#8217;s ready and may get a 2.1 version for ISO-8859-2.
