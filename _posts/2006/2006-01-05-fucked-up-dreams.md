I think because of my [Party of Five](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108894/) reference yesterday, I had a weird dream about it last night. I was somewhere and [Scott Wolf](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0937930/) was the doorman. (I&#8217;m not sure if it was Scott Wolf or Bailey Salinger.) I&#8217;m not sure if [Neve Campbell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000117/) and [Lacey Chabert](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000327/) were themselves or Julia and Claudia Salinger (in fact, I have a feeling that Neve Campbell was actually [Sidney Prescott](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/)). [Matthew Fox](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0289142/) wasn&#8217;t there, but somehow we ended up at &#8216;Matthew Fox Stadium&#8217;. (It was originally &#8216;[Nick Lachey](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005114/) Stadium&#8217;, but that was obviously not an appropriate reference.)

What the hell is wrong with me?
