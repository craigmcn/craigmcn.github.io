I recently broke up with my girlfriend and this sentiment has come into my mind a few times. For my last girlfriend, I made an effort not to change or be changed, because if she couldn&#8217;t love me for me, then we didn&#8217;t need to be together. This time around, I found that concept to be selfish and somewhat immature. It was certainly possible that there was a better version of me to be uncovered.

In the year we were together, I maybe wasn&#8217;t always successful in being better—we had a fight on New Year&#8217;s Eve, because I couldn&#8217;t easily apologize for an insensitive, off-hand remark. (And I should have; I was being stubborn.) But I was trying, and I felt that everything I was doing, I was doing for her. I hope now that I was also doing it for me.
