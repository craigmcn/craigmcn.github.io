  Happy Birthday to Me!
</p>

So, I had intended a quick post again after the babysitting gig, but I stayed for dinner, hung out a bit, then ended up going out for drinks with Santo/Nelson, Big B, and Santo/Nelson&#8217;s fianc√©e, E. She&#8217;s a little hottie, that&#8217;s for sure.

I went go-karting with my niece, Friday, then went with her and my sister to a new-ish sushi place, <a href="http://www.sushiro.com/" target="_blank">Sushiro</a>. Fantastic sushi, and great staff. We had a bit of a chat with the manager, very friendly. I highly recommend it!

Saturday was spent with my buddy J. My old University roommate R came by in the a.m. with his wife T and their son MR. Then J and I spent the day mostly screwing around. He took his Jeep Cherokee through these huge muddy puddles in this gravel parking lot and got the thing absolutely filthy &#8230; fantastic! We checked a couple of bike shops for some cruiser bikes, along the lines of the <a href="http://www.electrabike.com/Bikes/cruiser-ratfink-bikes-mens" target="_blank">Rat Fink</a>. Cool!

Then we went for some drinks, J&#8217;s wife R met us after work for some appis and beers. Then party-time! It was a housewarming for J and R and MY BIRTHDAY!! Woo Hoo! It was kind of funny, one of the girls who came over for the housewarming brought her husband and son &#8230; I had gone on a couple of dates with her back in the day &#8230; and if memory serves, I kind of made an ass of myself&#8230; Anyway my dad and step-mom were at the party, as well my sister and niece, J&#8217;s parents and my good friend Juicy, who got married last weekend. Happy Birthday to me!

Had a nice family dinner last night. And played Settlers of Catan. My dad and step-mom teamed up, since there was 5 of us and the game is only for 4, and they won, but I&#8217;m not sure dad really knew why he won. Good Times!
