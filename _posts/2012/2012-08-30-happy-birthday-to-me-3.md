Holy crap! 38 years old. Where&#8217;d half my life go? No, seriously, sometimes it feels like I&#8217;m well on my way to death and only barely getting started on life. Although, I suppose, when I was my niece&#8217;s age, my niece was born, so I guess I&#8217;ve had some time to get things going.

Birthday, birthday, happy birthday.<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-2647-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%; visibility: hidden;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/birthday\_song.mp3?\_=2" />

Thanks for all the birthday wishes, in person, in cards, over the phone and on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/craigmcnaughton)! Thanks to Veedub, Jock and Red for taking me out for pints and wings. Thanks to all the folks at work with whom I went for lunch.
