So, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all been wondering, where&#8217;s the Big Cracker? What&#8217;s he up to? Why isn&#8217;t he writing? Well, I&#8217;m here to answer those very questions &#8230;.. drum roll &#8230;. wait for it &#8230;..

I don&#8217;t know.

I haven&#8217;t been _too_ busy, but I&#8217;ve certainly been preoccupied.  On the advice of [Shuttergirl](http://my-dot.blogspot.com/), I started watching [Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_(TV_series)). What a super-duper show. Although, I&#8217;m pretty sure it couldn&#8217;t be broadcast anywhere but [HBO](http://www.hbocanada.com/online/), due to all the violence and nudity. I&#8217;m only about half-way through the first season, but I love it and I&#8217;m going to track down season two asap.

My sister got me watching [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/). I&#8217;m slowly making my way through seasons three, two and one, in that order, sort of. I&#8217;ve seen all of season three and really enjoyed it. (The Daleks got a little annoying.) I&#8217;ve seen most of season two and I don&#8217;t much care for [Rose Tyler](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/characters/rose). The stories are pretty good, but Rose has a kind of monkey face that gets on my nerves. I&#8217;ve sen a few episodes in season one and I like the dynamic between [this Doctor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/characters/doctor9) and Rose better than [the season two/three Doctor](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/characters/doctor10) and Rose, but not as much as the season two/three Doctor and [Martha Jones](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/characters/martha). (It might also be that Martha&#8217;s super-hot and Rose, as I said, has a monkey face.)

What else? Oh, yeah. Season two of [The IT Crowd](http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/) is HI-larious! I only have one or two episodes left (since the seasons are only six episodes). And I love it, again. The sets are a little better than season one and there&#8217;s a little more time spent outside the office. Plus, the stories get into a little more of the wacky personal life of introverts like [Moss and Roy](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-it-crowd/articles/character-profiles).

I also got out to see the [Sunparlour Players](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=48494366) at the [Rivoli](http://www.rivoli.ca/). [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/) was trying to describe their music and came up with &#8220;rootsy, bluegrass with  lot of yelling&#8221;. My definition was &#8220;hard rock, folksy, bluegrass&#8221;. Pretty close. In any case, a loud, foot-stompin&#8217; time with banjo. I also caught the [Worst Pop Band Ever](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com/) at [the Rex](http://www.therex.ca/) yesterday. Always a good show.
