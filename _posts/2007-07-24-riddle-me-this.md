**Spoiler Warning**

Can someone please explain to me how the [Elder Wand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Wand#Elder_Wand) passed to [Draco Malfoy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_Malfoy)? (Maybe I&#8217;ll post this as a question on Facebook and see what I get there.)

**Update:** Alrighty, I figured it all out. Draco defeated [Dumbledore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore) on the Astronomy tower by disarming him with the [_Expelliarmus_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spells_in_Harry_Potter#E) charm, Dumbledore&#8217;s wand was flung &#8220;in an arc over the edge of the ramparts&#8221;. [Severus Snape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severus_Snape) did indeed killed Dumbledore, hitting him &#8220;squarely in the chest&#8221; with the _[Avada Kedavra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgivable_Curses#Avada_Kedavra_.28The_Killing_Curse.29)_ curse, &#8220;and then he fell slowly backwards, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight.&#8221; But the wand had already passed to Malfoy. Then, after [Dobby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobby) caused the chandelier in the Malfoy Manor, &#8220;Draco doubled over&#8221; and Harry &#8220;wrested the three wands from Draco&#8217;s grip&#8221;. One of which was Draco&#8217;s own wand. Thus, Harry defeated Draco by disarming him. Shall I continue?
