I got a call from my friend Red this morning that obviously she just _had_ to make. She and [Veedub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/) had the kidlets out to swimming and saw some young woman who they thought would be perfect for me. I didn&#8217;t get any details about the _fr√§ulein_, but I was certainly intrigued. They&#8217;re trying to get me to move back to [Saskamatoon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/) and part of Red&#8217;s plan is to find me a nice girl I can&#8217;t resist. I&#8217;m waiting for further developments.
