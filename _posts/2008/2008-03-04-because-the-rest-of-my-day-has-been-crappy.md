One of the guys at work sent this. My day has been a giant pile of crap, so this brightened things a little. Especially since a few people in the office have been the lawyer and I can imagine being the cop.

> A London lawyer runs a stop sign and gets pulled over by a Glasgow copper. He thinks that he is smarter than the cop because he is a lawyer from _London_ and is certain that he has a better education than any Jock cop.
> 
> He decides to prove this to himself and have some fun at the Glasgow cop&#8217;s expense!!
> 
> Glasgow Cop says, &#8220;Licence and registration, please.&#8221;
> 
> London Lawyer says, &#8220;What for?&#8221;
  
> Glasgow Cop says, &#8220;Ye didnae come to a complete stop at the stop sign.&#8221;
  
> London Lawyer says, &#8220;I slowed down, and no one was coming.&#8221;
  
> Glasgow Cop says, &#8220;Ye still didnae come to a complete stop. Licence and registration, please.&#8221;
  
> London Lawyer says, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;
> 
> Glasgow Cop says, &#8220;The difference is, ye huvte to come to a complete stop, that&#8217;s the law. Licence and registration, please!&#8221;
> 
> London Lawyer says, &#8220;If you can show me the legal difference between slow down and stop, I&#8217;ll give you my licence and registration and you give me the ticket. If not, you let me go and don&#8217;t give me the ticket.&#8221;
  
> Glasgow Cop says, &#8220;Sounds fair. Exit your vehicle, sir.&#8221;
  
> The London Lawyer exits his vehicle.
> 
> The Glasgow Cop takes out his baton and starts beating the f*ck out of the lawyer and says, &#8220;Dae ye want me to stop, or just slow doon?&#8221;
