The title hearkens back to [Gwildor&#8217;s](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) bachelor party. It seems appropriate since I&#8217;m just back from RLP&#8217;s bachelor party. I don&#8217;t have a lot to say about it, since I only went for dinner and a few drinks. The boys went out for [whirlyball](http://whirlyball.sites.toronto.com/), dinner at [the Keg](http://www.kegsteakhouse.com/), drinks at [Nectar](http://nectarrestaurant.foodpages.ca/) and then were planning to head to [For Your Eyes Only](http://www.foryoureyesonly-club.com/default.htm)Â (nsfw*). Good steaks at the Keg and good [new] friends. Some interesting conversation about the music industry in Canada, since there were a bunch of music types in the group.

**Update:** I gather they had a really good time at FYEO, getting RLP falling-down drunk and seeing young ladies in their finest attire.
