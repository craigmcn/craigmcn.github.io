Woo Hoo!! crackerMail v1.0 has been released!! I gave up trying to write a login function, it was just getting too messy and too complicated. So I required a password-protected folder. I installed it myself, using the instructions in the readme.txt file, and it worked like a charm. I can&#8217;t imagine too many people are going to be using it, but it&#8217;s a fun project. Now onto v2.0!

So, I mentioned that I&#8217;m in a <a href="http://www.bartendingontario.com" target="_blank">bartending course</a> and it&#8217;s a ton of fun. But it&#8217;s a lot of memorization. The instructor suggested making flashcards and having a friend quiz us. Well, I&#8217;m far too internet- and technology-oriented for &#8216;flashcards&#8217;, so I&#8217;m in the process of building a web-based quiz. I&#8217;ve added all the drinks (from the manual, not all the drinks in the world!) to a database &#8230; using MS-Excel to build a spreadsheet, then a VB macro to build the SQL statements, then my quick-and-dirty dBase manager to add the info! Now I&#8217;m in the process of building the quiz, which will allow me to select the drinks to review, remember which drinks I reviewed the last time, then randomly go through the selected drinks, prompting for the information, allowing me to compare to the data in the database, assign a mark, then give me my final score. It&#8217;ll take me another day or so, but I think it&#8217;ll really help me study!

**Update (Nov. 1) &#8230;** crackerMail v1.0 has had to be re-released with 2 major bug fixes identified by <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Gwildor</a>. Problems were caused by multiple mailboxes with the same username. Once that was fixed, the &#8216;From&#8217; name was blank when sending email.
