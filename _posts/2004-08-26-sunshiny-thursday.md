Just a quick update on a sunshiny Thursday morn&#8217; in Saskatoon .. ToonTown .. the Bridge City .. Hub City &#8230; well, whatever. There&#8217;ll be more this evening after my babysitting gig with J & R&#8217;s little red-heads, P & E. P is a left-handed, red-head &#8230; I don&#8217;t remember what that means, but I know each used to be bad stigma on its own, and she&#8217;s both. But she&#8217;s fantastic. So&#8217;s the littler one, E. R&#8217;s a red-head, so it&#8217;s not really surprising that the kids are too. R still hasn&#8217;t found me a woman. From what I understand, she hasn&#8217;t found any single women, period. J thought of 1 young lady, but she has waaaaaay too much baggage. I&#8217;ve got my own issues, let alone have to deal with someone else&#8217;s. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m single anyway. Woo Hoo! More than 10 years single!!

I managed to get out to see my buddy Santo/Nelson and his buddy, Big B. They were out to get shoes for Santo/Nelson&#8217;s wedding in October. Then we went for beers at a new Irish pub in town. The beers were good, the service was good, but the place was mostly empty. And I hear the food&#8217;s nothing to look forward to &#8230; too bad, nice atmosphere.

Well, <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and I might have a customer for our web hosting business. One of my sister&#8217;s friends has a business and I had an email from her business partner, so I&#8217;ve got that discussion on the go. I think it should be promising &#8230;

Take care, and get back to work!
