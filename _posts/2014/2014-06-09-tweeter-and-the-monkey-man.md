This one came across my music player this morning and now I&#8217;m sharing it with you. This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Tweeter and the Monkey Man_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweeter_and_the_Monkey_Man) by [The Traveling Wilburys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys) from 1988 debut album, [Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_Wilburys_Vol._1). [The Headstones](http://www.headstonesband.com/)&#8216; version is from their 1993 debut, [Picture of Health](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_of_Health).

The video for the Headstones version seems to be an amateur effort pieced together from the 2012 [Oliver Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone) movie, [Savages](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615065/), which received mixed reviews.
