If you&#8217;ve seen the [Will Ferrell movie generator](http://www.collegehumor.com/article/877550/the-will-ferrell-movie-generator), you know the major storyline of the movie. The sidekick in this case is [Jon Heder](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1417647/). The surprise cameo is [Luke Wilson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005561/) as a sex therapist. [Romany Malco](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0539082/) is fun as an effeminate (if not actually gay) choreographer&#8211;a bit of a change from the tough guy drug dealer from [Weeds](http://www.sho.com/sho/weeds/home). [Ferrell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002071/) does a pretty decent job channelling [Jim Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison) (with the long, wavy hair, aviators and leather pants). And I have to give credit to [Craig T. Nelson](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005266/) playing the [coach](http://www.tv.com/coach/show/507/summary.html)—a little self-deprecating humour goes a long way for me. Some good, fun performances from [Will Arnett](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004715/) and [Amy Poehler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0688132/). It&#8217;s a shame [Jenna Fischer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0278979/)&#8216;s character isn&#8217;t better developed, she&#8217;s shown a lot of promise in [The Office](http://www.tv.com/shows/the-office/).

Overall, dudes figure skating is a fun, original premise, but we&#8217;ve seen similar with [Dodgeball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364725/), [Kicking & Screaming](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384642/) and [Zoolander](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196229/) (and the upcoming [Balls of Fury](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424823/)). Again, sadly, it completely fits the standard Will Ferrell plot outline, so there&#8217;s nothing really new. The solid ensemble cast comes with good comedy backgrounds, but they need a more original story to make it work.

6 out of 10 saltines. It&#8217;s a renter, “same old, same old” only goes so far.
