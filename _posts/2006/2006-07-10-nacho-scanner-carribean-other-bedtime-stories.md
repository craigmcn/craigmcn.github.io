Friday night was a trip down to the [Harbourfront](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/) with Cyon and, umm, [Sonya](http://sonyamatteo.com/) (I think I need to find out a nickname for Sonya). We caught some of [Prefuse 73](http://prefuse73.com/). I was expecting lyrics, but it was just Prefuse and a drummer. The beats and mixes were good, but to my untrained ear all the tracks blended into one.

Saturday afternoon was [Nacho Libre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457510/). My sister asked if it was funny, and, to be honest, I&#8217;m still not sure. There were some funny scenes and situations with [Nacho](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0085312/) and [Esqueleto](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422948/) and the wrestling was pretty comedic, but it wasn&#8217;t a laugh-riot and no <a>School of Rock</a>. Still good &#8230; 7 out of 10 saltines.

Saturday night was supposed to be another trip down to the [Harbourfront](http://www.harbourfrontcentre.com/) with [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/art/) and [RLP](http://www.myspace.com/ryanlpatterson), but I ran into RLP on my way out to Nacho and he said he wasn&#8217;t sure he was going. Of course, he didn&#8217;t call h!, since I said I was going. But I hadn&#8217;t confirmed with h! what was going on and I decided not to go. I failed to check my messages when I got home from Nacho, and didn&#8217;t get h!&#8217;s message about when and where he would be. Anyways &#8230; h! called me from a payphone at the Harbourfront, we sorted everything out and I rode my bike over to his place to hang out and chat. Good times!

Sunday was my day for illegal activity. (Yeah, come and get me coppers! You&#8217;ll never take me alive!) I went down to the [Varsity](http://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/TheatreDetails/Cineplex-Odeon-Varsity-and-VIP-Cinemas.aspx) for [A Scanner Darkly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296/), and since it ended about 20 minutes before [Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man&#8217;s Chest](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/pirates/), I figured I&#8217;d buy one and get one free. At the Varsity, once you&#8217;re in, you&#8217;re free to roam about at your leisure; so after Scanner, I casually walked into Pirates. Anyways &#8230; yeah, like Gwildor said, Scanner dragged a bit and, for me, it ended abruptly, without a clear resolution. The animation was pretty good, digitized over real film very elegantly, and the story was a little wacky and fun. I&#8217;ll say 6.5 saltines.

Pirates, also good, fun, good effects with the Big Cracken (almost Big Cracker!) and Davy Jones&#8217; crew, but it ran a little long. The fight sequence in the end between Will Turner, Captain Jack Sparrow and Commodore Norrington was unnecessarily long and only made the non-ending (à la [Matrix: Reloaded](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/)) more disappointing. Uhhh &#8230; 7 saltines.
