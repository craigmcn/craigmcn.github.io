So, I got an e-mail from this girl I went to school with who is trying to organize a Grade 8 reunion. (For those unfamiliar with the Saskatchewan school system, we go from Kindergarten to grade 8 in elementary school, then 9 to 12 in high school; no grade 13, OAC, CEGEP, middle school or junior high.) So there was 20 or so of us who graduated from grade 8 together and most of us had been together since kindergarten. (J was in it from the beginning, but I joined up in grade 3, my buddy Yateser in grade 5 and good ol&#8217; Dallas Green in grade 8.) I&#8217;m not quite sure what this has to do with anything, but I&#8217;m debating whether I should begin to plan going. I mean, I haven&#8217;t kept in touch with these people, and I have no intention to start. I don&#8217;t know.

In other news, I got to go to another [Toronto Rock](http://www.torontorock.com/) lacrosse game last night. Woo Hoo! Go Rock! Rock our sox! They haven&#8217;t had a fantastic season, but they won last night. In fact, they completely dominated the game! They were up 3 goals on the [Edmonton Rush](http://www.edmontonrush.com/) within 1m:25s. There was a little pushing and shoving and a couple of 5 minute majors, but nothing like the last game I was at&#8211;with about 6 full-on fights in the last five minutes. Good times!

Oh and I&#8217;m thinking of changing the layout of my site and probably trimming down the main page. Any suggestions?
