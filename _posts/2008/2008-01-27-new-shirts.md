Does anybody know anybody who makes shirts? Or _would make_ shirts if asked nicely enough? I own 3 shirts that I love and that I think fit me well. But as with most store-bought, off-the-rack stuff, it usually only lasts a season and then the company doesn’t make it anymore. So I’m out of luck trying to buy more of the same shirts. I’d be willing to pay someone to make a handful of shirts based on the design of the shirts that I have. I would think that someone competent could take my shirts and re-create them, without completely destroying my shirts (maybe).

So anyone have any ideas?
