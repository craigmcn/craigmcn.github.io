The [white poppy v. red poppy debate](remembrance-poppies-red-v-white.html 'Remembrance Poppies: Red v. White') [came up again this year](http://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=1039666). I&#8217;m disappointed. Again, I argue that while the white poppy may be intended to promote peace, the red poppy does not promote nor glorify war. I don’t believe that anyone wearing a red poppy does so in support of war.

This day makes me remember my Dad&#8217;s dad who served in Europe in World War Two, and had he been born a few years earlier, could have served in the First World War. It makes me remember my Mom&#8217;s dad who served in Europe in the Second World War. It makes me remember my Mom&#8217;s mom who worked in a munitions factory during World War Two. It makes me remember my Dad&#8217;s mom who was a nurse during the Second World War, and became a nurse partly because the hospitals actually had food regularly. And it makes me think of my Dad and my uncle who wouldn&#8217;t have been born if my grandparents hadn&#8217;t met in the Netherlands and my Nana hadn&#8217;t chosen to immigrate to Canada. This story is repeated with my stepmom&#8217;s parents.

It makes me remember a story my Nana told me about riding her bicycle from one town to another, stopping at her house along the way and finding it occupied with a German patrol. On that same trip, or perhaps another, she&#8217;d been asked to bring a loaf of bread to a friend&#8217;s family. They were surprised and thankful that she actually brought it to them and didn&#8217;t eat it herself, or possibly sell it along the way.

And it makes me think of Chris, Gwen, Victoria and Mackenzie Bourque. They probably don&#8217;t remember me, but I remember Chris and Gwen from the short time I served with the North Saskatchewan Regiment in the Armed Forces reserve, 20 years ago. Chris lost his battle with post-traumatic stress disorder last year; he&#8217;d served in Bosnia and Afghanistan.

It&#8217;s not just soldiers and veterans that I&#8217;m remembering here, it&#8217;s families that exist because of war, and torn apart by it. It&#8217;s people who worked to support war efforts and became who they were because of it. And at no time, especially when I&#8217;m wearing a red poppy, do I believe that war is glorious or should be promoted or celebrated.
