Boy, the weather this winter sure has gotten me down. I&#8217;ve worked from home a couple of times, mostly because I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to get ready and go to work. (Partly, people at work bug the hell out of me, but that&#8217;s a different situation.)

We&#8217;ve had snow on the ground and consistently freezing temperatures here since October 25—we&#8217;re pushing six months of winter. Yes, it&#8217;s Canada. Yes, it&#8217;s Saskatchewan. I understand, and I chose to live here, but I&#8217;m tired. And grumpy. And just want to sit outside on a lawn chair, on my lawn, and read a book while drinking a cold beer. Is that too much to ask? It&#8217;s April for cryin&#8217; out loud!

I probably could have enjoyed a hot holiday in the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) and thawed out a bit. But it sort of took me a while to get things figured out and by then I was destined to a conference in Las Vegas that I thought would be equally enjoyable. I just didn&#8217;t think the winter would last so friggin&#8217; long!

So, rather than actually wanting to do anything—like going to work—I prefer to sit at my computer, or in front of the TV, or in my bed with my tablet, pretending the world doesn&#8217;t exist. Is anyone else in my situation? What do you do about it?
