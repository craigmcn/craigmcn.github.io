While today may not have been a banner day for an uncle hoping for a prize nomination (sorry, I won&#8217;t get into the details), I found out about an awesome contest for which I should be a [shoo-in](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=shoo-in). [A & W](http://www.aw.ca/) is running the Ultimate Uncle Contest, for which the grand prize is a trip for four to my former stompin&#8217; grounds, the [Fairmont Banff Springs](http://www.fairmont.com/BanffSprings?cm_mmc=icppc-_-Branded-BSH%20-%20Banff%20Springs%20-%20Canada-_-google-_-fairmont+banff+springs+hotel) hotel. For those of you so inclined, hook me up!
