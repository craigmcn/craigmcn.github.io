I was so good about blogging last week, this week, not so much. I&#8217;ve been a little busy putting the finishing touches on the [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/) website &#8230; [h!](http://www.ppfhouse.com/animation.php) is a little picky and has been changing the layout and content like mad. It&#8217;s all good times &#8230; sh&#8211;s and giggles! I&#8217;m also trying to get a few pages of my own done, to advertise my web development skills and my tetherball skills, but that&#8217;s taking it&#8217;s sweet time.

I think I&#8217;m going to push towards freelance web development. I mean, I&#8217;m already a partner in a great hosting company, and I&#8217;ve done some solid work on a handful of websites. Daddy-O even sent me a web design and logo/letterhead design opportunity that unfortunately I was not ready to do at the time. But I&#8217;m putting together some plans and a portfolio, so hopefully the next time something similar comes up, I&#8217;ll be ready.

I had a discussion with a colleague at work the other day, and I&#8217;m not sure I presented the case as best as I could have. I mentioned that we&#8217;re doing some reorganization at work, and that a few people are losing their jobs. Well, this colleague is one of them. He&#8217;s been offered a position that is similar to what [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and I do, and he wanted the inside scoop. I tried to present a fair and balanced view of my work, but I have a feeling I put a little too much negative spin on it. I mean, I don&#8217;t much care for the work I do (hmmm &#8230; I wonder if people I work with actually read this?), but it&#8217;s not really a nighmarish pit of hell. I tried to present it like it&#8217;s fairly laid back, timelines are long enough that it&#8217;s easy enough to get the work done, but that it&#8217;s still work and there&#8217;s always bullsh&#8211;. I certainly hope that&#8217;s the impression I gave, and not the [7th circle of hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Divine_Comedy).

Oh, and 3 movies on the long weekend past: [Fantastic Four](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/) (good), [Batman Begins](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0372784/) (excellent), [The Island](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/) (very good).
