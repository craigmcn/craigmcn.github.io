Boy! What a weekend! Here we are Monday morning (at work, of course, so that somebody will pay me to blog!), and it&#8217;s really the first chance I&#8217;ve had to just sit down, relax and consider what has been going on. Although, we&#8217;re busy at work (well, I am &#8230; I don&#8217;t know about [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) &#8230; ha ha!) so while I started writing this before 9am, it&#8217;ll likely be noon before it&#8217;s finished&#8230;. Actually, it turns out I didn&#8217;t finished until 7:15pm.

Saturday, I went to see [War of the Worlds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/)&#8230;not exactly what I was expecting. There was plenty of action, but the story and the moral of the story got lost somewhere along the line. [Morgan Freeman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/)Â has a short monologue at the beginning and another at the end that (I think) are supposed to explain some of the elements that somehow a spectacular filmmaker like [Steven Spielberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000229/) was unable to explain in the movie. And I&#8217;m still not sure I understood what happened.

After the movie, I went out and bought myself a new laptop computer! That&#8217;s how Big Cracker goes mobile. I&#8217;m going to be retiring my Linux web server and migrating all my web development projects to the laptop. Hopefully, this means that projects will get done more quickly &#8230; or not.

Sunday afternoon I went to see [The 40 Year Old Virgin](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405422/). What an excellent movie! The only bad thing about it is how much it parallels my own life! A dork living alone with too many toys and no girlfriend and no prospects for a long-term relationship. But, man, was it funny!! More frat-boy funny than generally funny, and while it might not be too bad for a date, I don&#8217;t think the girls will get all the penis humour. I highly recommend it!

And tonight is a spoken word &#8230; uhh &#8230; presentation? I guess that what you&#8217;d call it. It&#8217;s called PROactive Words and features my old pal, [LEO37](http://www.ppfhouse.com/leo37/). I&#8217;ll let you know later this week how it was.
