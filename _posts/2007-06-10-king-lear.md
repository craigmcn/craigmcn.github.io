[Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare) at [Stratford](http://www.stratfordfestival.ca/), what more do I need to say? But seriously, I went to see _King Lear_ this afternoon and it was great. Although, really, Stratford is supposed to be great; especially for [Shakespeare](http://shakespeare.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page), so they do have a lot to live up to. And I guess they did.

If you really want to see Shakespeare done right, see it at Stratford. You won&#8217;t get _[Romeo and Juliet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet)_ done up like _[West Side Story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_Story)_ (although, I guess that&#8217;s what _West Side Story_ is), you won&#8217;t get _[King Lear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear)_ done up like _[Wall Street](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_(1987_film))_ and you won&#8217;t get _[The Merchant of Venice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice)_ done up like _[Goodfellas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodfellas)_. But you&#8217;ll get solid Shakespeare done by solid actors and not overwhelmed by fancy sets and lighting.Â  You&#8217;ll get what Shakespeare intended.
