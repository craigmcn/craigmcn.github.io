Okay, so this is old news to a ton of people, but, man, I was just thinking of [Strong Bad&#8217;s email](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html) on [homestarrunner.com](http://www.homestarrunner.com). The one specifically is the [Guitar](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail36.html). I mean, jug jigga jug jigga JAH JAH! That&#8217;s some of the funniest stuff &#8230;. [Dragon](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html)&#8216;s pretty funny and [Kid&#8217;s Book](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail84.html) rocks, too. &#8220;I will burninate you, Trogdor!&#8221;
