This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Sympathy for the Devil_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy_for_the_Devil) by
[The Rolling Stones](http://rollingstones.com/) from their 1968 album,
[Beggars Banquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggars_Banquet). The [Sandie Shaw](http://www.sandieshaw.com/)
version is from her 1969 album, [Reviewing the Situation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reviewing_the_Situation).

I found this on a [15 worst cover songs of all time](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/the-15-worst-cover-songs-of-all-time-a3872651.html) post. There were other acceptable options, but this was pretty bad. In my opinion, Sandie Shaw’s pop tone just doesn’t fit the content.
