Alright, alright, I&#8217;m posting, I&#8217;m posting!!

I realize it&#8217;s been 2 weeks, but I&#8217;ve been moving. I only got my internet running Saturday. It still took some time to get the emails working. I ended up calling Sympatico support, who provided me completely different instructions for setting up my email than what they had provided in the install kit. Ridiculous.

Also, last week I renewed my cell phone plan and thought I got the right features package. No, no, I didn&#8217;t get my call forwarding, which is the only thing I really need. So the poor people trying to call me (sorry, Daddy-O and [h!](http://www.ppfhouse.com/century.php)) just get my voicemail. But I thought the cell was forwarded to my inside number, so it was turned off! Anyway, that&#8217;s all straightened out.

Last but not least, Externalgateway.com has changed service providers, so the site&#8217;s been down the last week until I could access the [cPanel](http://www.cpanel.net/) to set everything back to normal.

Whew! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; home to watch [Firefly](http://www.fireflyfans.net/)! Oh, and maybe start work on crackerMail upgrades for [Big Gwilly Style](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and Cyon.
