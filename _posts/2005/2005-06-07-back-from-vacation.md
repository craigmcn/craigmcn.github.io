Alrighty, I&#8217;m back from vacation &#8230; You&#8217;d almost think I fell off the face of the earth, but I didn&#8217;t. Sorry to disappoint you. The big problem was Daddy-O&#8217;s computer that crashed during 3 blog attempts, and then my own idiocy during another. I clicked a link in an email and it opened the link in the same window as the (very long) blog, thus losing the blog entirely.

I will quickly mention some highlights of the vacation, since now I&#8217;m much too tired to go into any great detail (sorry)&#8230; I went to the [LEO37](http://www.ppfhouse.com/leo37/) gig at Amigo&#8217;s; [Off Broadway Dinner Theatre](http://www.offbroadway.ca/) for _A Perfect Wedding_, starring Nelson&#8217;s wife, Emtamily; J & R&#8217;s daughter, Little P&#8217;s (5 years old) little league soccer game; and a 2<sup>nd</sup> go &#8217;round of [Revenge of the Sith](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/). I won 60 bucks (thanks, suckahs!!) in a Texas Hold &#8216;Em poker game with J & R, Big T, Jonny B and Jonny&#8217;s wife, Little T. It was Winner-Take-All, and we each put $10 into the pot. I got to paint Daddy-O&#8217;s fence and mow his lawn (Woo Hoo!). As always was the family luncheon Saturday, and then some hottubbin&#8217; at J&#8217;s parents&#8217; place. The final Saturday was a trip up to Beatty, SK to visit Wublub and Gonch, and the [greenhouse](http://www.wrightsgreenhouse.com/). All in all &#8230; Good times!!

And now &#8230; Back to work.
