To diverge from what have been very personal, somewhat polarizing, posts of the last few weeks, here&#8217;s just a little commentary on what I know to be some hypocrisy on my part. If there&#8217;s a passive-aggressive jab to be made, it&#8217;s at myself, and self-deprecation is usually hilarious.

There was a time when I wore a uniform at work. Later, I wore suits. Later again, I was able to wear khakis or cords and polo shirts, and jeans on Fridays! After a while, I decided that I wanted to look more professional, yet still comfortable, and wore dress shirts, sport coats and neat, dark wash jeans, with nice dress boots.

It was in this phase that I frowned on colleagues who wore jeans and tshirts, because I felt it was unprofessional and untidy—I almost want to say slovenly, but that seems harsh. I appreciated that their work was more manual in nature and the possibility of ending up in a dirty storage room or under a dusty desk was pretty high. But I still felt there was a tidier, more professional option.

I&#8217;m still generally of that opinion, but certainly tempered a little. Now I wear jeans and tshirts. Nice, well-kept, properly-fitting tshirts and neat, well-kept jeans. I usually wear some casual leather boots, not sneakers, and often wear a cardigan when I&#8217;m not just sitting at my desk. I feel like I&#8217;m put together.

One reason that I felt the need to dress up a little was to be professional, but I&#8217;ve found that my work does that for me. I do a good job, in a timely manner; I stay connected with the people for whom I do work; and I keep myself updated on my industry (even though I can&#8217;t always implement everything I learn).

So while I might have been vitriolic in the past about the appearance of my colleagues, they might now say the same about me. And probably should, but I&#8217;m good with it. I&#8217;m comfortable with my work, my role and my responsibilities and I don&#8217;t need to dress up to show it.
