I just thought I&#8217;d publish some handy tips to help out people as they wander in public:

  1. Vary as much as possible your walking speed, ensuring that you speed up as soon as someone tries to pass you. As soon as you pass someone, slow down so they have to avoid walking on your heels.
  2. If you need to stop to chat with a friend or because you&#8217;re unsure of where you need to go, make sure you do it on or around stairways or in or around doorways. This allows you the most options once you decide to start moving again.
  3. If you need to change your direction of travel, do it as abruptly as possible and ensure that your new direction is the opposite of the prevailing direction of everyone else.

If you follow these practical tips, I assure youÂ that you will fit much better into the general flow of traffic, since you&#8217;ll be doing what everyone else is doing.
