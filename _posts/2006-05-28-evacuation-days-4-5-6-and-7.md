So, the evac was really over Thursday afternoon when my Mommy came into town. We stayed at a hotel near her conference. I drove my fancy [rental car](http://www.mazda.ca/MciWeb/displayPage.action?pageParameter=modelsMain&vehicleCode=M3S#/home) to work. Then drove back to the hotel after work. I managed to stop by the disaster zone and get some pictures, but the holes were already cemented over.

We spent Saturday in London, visiting Mommy&#8217;s friends and our family. Good times, but a little stressful when visiting my great aunt who has some personal issues, living on her own most of the time, at 85 years old, which tend to alienate people.

And now I&#8217;m back! Getting the disaster zone back together. It&#8217;s not as bad as it could be, but it&#8217;s not completely fixed. The concrete still has to cure for the rest of the week, then new tile has to be laid. My super-duper landlord laid some rugs and stuff over the bare concrete, so you really don&#8217;t know there&#8217;s a problem.

Anyway &#8230; back to getting stuff tidied up before Mommy has to spend the night!
