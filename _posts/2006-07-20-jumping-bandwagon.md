Okay, so if [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) gets to get excited about his job interview, then I&#8217;ll mention mine, too. I had a phone interview last night as a technical writer for a software development company. The interview went well and so I have to show up in person Monday afternoon. My only issue is that they want to see a sample of my technical writing documents, of which I have precious few. Mostly because it&#8217;s all proprietary and if I stripped it down to remove the proprietary stuff, there&#8217;d be nothing left. Also, they want documents for technical people and mine are for end-users.

The one thing I hate about job interviews is having to toot my own horn. Anything I do or did or whatever, I did it because it was my job or it helped someone out. And I don&#8217;t necessarily remember it particularly positively or negatively. But they always want to hear about something that was a spectacular success or something that was a spectacular failure or a time when I had to fix a spectacular mistake or something I&#8217;m spectacularly proud of. I rarely remember, and even if I do remember something it never seems quite as spectacular as I would like it to be.

Well, I&#8217;m still excited, so we&#8217;ll see what happens!
