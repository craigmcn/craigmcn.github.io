I had a super-duper night last night and none of it was planned.

It was supposed to be [D&D](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/) night, but the [DM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master) cancelled at the last possible moment. I had to ride the subway (from [Finch to McCowan](http://www.ttc.ca/Routes/index.jsp)) for over an hour to get all the hell way out to [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s neck o&#8217; the woods. only to find out that our evening plans were cancelled. Gwildor rescued the evening by proposing some [Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan) (that [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/) won) and [Guitar Hero 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_III:_Legends_of_Rock) (I&#8217;ll be buying it Friday).

I even got home early enough to get some [homework](http://calendardb.humber.ca/LIS/WebCalendar/CE/CourseOffering.do?name=CCL._208) done. (I had some allergy issues and my eyeball swelled up, but it&#8217;ll be better within a few days.)
