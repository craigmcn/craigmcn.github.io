Sorry for my extended silence this week. I&#8217;ve been working on redesigning this site and have run into some problems. I was hoping to clean up the URLs and folders, but that has revealed issues in some other areas. Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll sort it out.

I&#8217;ve also decided that I&#8217;ll follow the [Qwerty/Home Row method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing#Home_row) of touch-typing when writing these posts. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s still a slow process. If ever I get to a point where I no longer have to look at the keyboard when I type, or have to think about each letter, I may look into theÂ [Dvorak Simplified Keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard) layout. But not quite yet.

I have several posts that I&#8217;m working on, but they&#8217;re all suffering from my slow keyboarding. Perhaps I&#8217;ll forego the touch-typing periodically to get some posts done.

What do you think, a little sacrifice for a little gain?
