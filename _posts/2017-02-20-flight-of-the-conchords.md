This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [Flight of the Conchords](http://flightoftheconchords.co.nz/), their 2008 originals [_The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_(Flight_of_the_Conchords)) and [_Business Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Returns).

I had the line &#8220;part-time model&#8221; in my head the other day for who knows what reason. Now I’m sharing the origin with you, and another great song of theirs.
