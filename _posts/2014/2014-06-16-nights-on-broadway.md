This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is the [Bee Gees&#8217;](http://www.beegees.com/)Â [_Nights on Broadway_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_on_Broadway) from their 1975 album [Main Course](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Course). I was at our staff appreciation picnic last week and the song was playing on the big sound system that had been set up. The only thing I could hear was the theme song to the [Barry Gibb Talk Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barry_Gibb_Talk_Show) on Saturday Night Live. A funny parody and really well done, but I like the story the original song tells.
