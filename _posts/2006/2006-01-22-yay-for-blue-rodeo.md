I know [Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) doesn&#8217;t care much for the [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/), but they&#8217;re easily my favourite band of all time. I finally got a chance to see them again last night at [Massey Hall](http://www.masseyhall.com/), for the first time in 12 years and a day. Seriously, the last time I saw Blue Rodeo perform was January 20, 1994, on their [Five Days in July](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/five-days-in-july/) tour. That date sticks in my head because it was the last day I had an actual girlfriend. Yes, I&#8217;ve seen some nice girls since then, but we&#8217;ve never actually dated.

Also, the next day I saw [Rymes with Orange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rymes_with_Orange) for the first time (so 12 years ago to the day, as of last night). I have a feeling they opened for someone else, but I don&#8217;t remember, &#8217;cause I was drunk. I&#8217;d been drinking rye and iced tea (&#8217;cause that was all the mix there was) and was absolutely shitfaced. We went to the [campus bar](http://www.ussu.ca/louis/), and I was already wasted. I had a few more drinks. Why, I can&#8217;t possibly imagine. But I proceeded to vomit all over the table I was sitting at and, surprise, surprise, the staff threw me out! They were polite enough to pay for my cab ride home, and Al&#8217;s cab ride back, &#8217;cause he wasn&#8217;t gonna miss the show!!

Anyway, what an excellent show! Of course, they played some of the fan favourites:Â [Heart like Mine](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=69aa4ecd-4585-4742-8bf8-2c1a7f09745a), [Bad Timing](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=be1e2656-ad3e-4d91-9eed-4401cddb8431), [Five Days in May](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=009224aa-e99a-421a-81a4-f6cf5a97b79a), [Hasn&#8217;t Hit Me Yet](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=cbd4b287-4306-4491-86c7-2343831eef68), [Diamond Mine](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=b886ac9a-7c52-4367-a6c6-3ecc7d456fee), [Try](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=98f462d5-c4d9-452d-b7c8-da7d2e42a4e0), [Bulletproof](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=3bdfe097-35da-4df9-9920-28889ff0aef5) &#8230; need I go on? And of course played a bunch of stuff from [the new album](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/are-you-ready-2/): Can&#8217;t Help Wondering Why, Are you Ready, Rena, I Will, Tired of Pretending. They had Kate Boothman (of the Real Priscillas) sing backup on [Can&#8217;t Help Wondering Why](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=c8102672-117a-43d9-9bdb-e43343bc2b07) (I was hoping to link to either a Kate Boothman or Real Priscillas site, but therealpriscillas.com <del>is broken</del> doesn&#8217;t exist, sorry). And [Bazil Donovan](http://www.bluerodeo.com/about/bazildonovan.aspx#subtitle_profile) sang [Stage Door](http://www.bluerodeo.com/music/songography/br_lyrics.aspx?songid=8ea58b60-e15b-4353-99fa-d350f20e9a61), very excellent.

[Justin Rutledge](http://www.justinrutledge.com/) opened and performed very well. I don&#8217;t have much to say, I wasn&#8217;t paying a bucket load of attention to him. There was no mention of an opening act, he wasn&#8217;t introduced, and until the 3rd song in about a six song set he didn&#8217;t introduce himself. So for those first 2 songs, it was just some dude playing guitar, with some other dudes backing him up. Mind you, one of the other dudes was [Bazil Donovan](http://www.bluerodeo.com/about/bazildonovan.aspx#subtitle_profile) on bass, but that didn&#8217;t mean a lot at the time. It was good stuff, enjoyable, with a bit of an absurdist bent, which generally appeals to me.
