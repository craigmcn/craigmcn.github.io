Fun times. This was my second house guest since I moved to the new apartment over a year ago. Juicy is in town for some [MBA](http://www.ivey.uwo.ca/) recruiting (interviews and interviews for the whole week; good luck to her). While it&#8217;s a bit of a challenge, it&#8217;s a good opportunity to tidy up my house and use my &#8220;guest linen&#8221;. I&#8217;ve got boxes and boxes of crap I need to get rid of, so I just dumped them all in the back bedroom, with enough room to get to the computer. I cleaned the bathroom and kitchen, but I didn&#8217;t get all the vacuuming done. And Juicy had some issues with the lack of food in my fridge. I didn&#8217;t happen to mention that I go shopping about twice a week, and there&#8217;s only me in my house. We had a good visit, we went for some dinner and then just hung out and shot the shit. Juicy&#8217;s got some wild stuff going on with her MBA. I&#8217;m surprised that it&#8217;s as versatile as it seems. Maybe I&#8217;ll start thinking about it again.
