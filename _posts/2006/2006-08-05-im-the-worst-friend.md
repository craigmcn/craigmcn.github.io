It&#8217;s my good friend Juicy&#8217;s birthday today, so I sent her a birthday e-mail. I would have called her, but I haven&#8217;t spoken to her in almost 2 years. What kind of friend am I? The problem is that the longer I wait, the guiliter I feel and then I just don&#8217;t want to face it anymore.

I&#8217;m in the same boat with my friend JC in Hamilton. We met in Banff 7 or 8 years ago and we&#8217;ve stayed in contact (an e-mail every 6 months). But I have a standing invitation to head out to Hamilton for a visit and every time I think about it, it never seems like a good time, so I&#8217;ve put it off now for about 8 months.

To anyone else I&#8217;ve avoided, ignored and generally not communicated with in years and years: I&#8217;m really sorry. You&#8217;re always on my mind—Prairie Vixen, Mac & Cheese, you too—and I miss you. (Yeah, yeah, cornball, but it&#8217;s true.)
