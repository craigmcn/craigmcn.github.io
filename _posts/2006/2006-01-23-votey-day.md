Alrighty everybody, today is Votey Day. As I said to my mommy, I don&#8217;t care who you vote for, just vote. Sure, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t vote, you don&#8217;t get to complain.&#8221; The response I heard to that was: &#8220;I don&#8217;t complain.&#8221; Really. I don&#8217;t give a rat&#8217;s ass. Grow some _cojones_ and make a statement that you actually have a conscience and some idea of what you want for this country. No more excuses!

From CTV.ca: “After eight weeks of often bitter campaigning, it is now up to Canadians to choose whether to continue 13 years of Liberal rule, or move the country toward a more conservative right.”

Really? That&#8217;s my choice? What if I want to choose to embrace a [Marxist-Leninist](http://www.cpcml.ca/) or [Marijuana Party](http://www.marijuanaparty.ca/) agenda? Isn&#8217;t that also my choice? Obviously not according to Canada&#8217;s pre-eminent broadcast communications company.

Whatever &#8230; I&#8217;ll be complying with [Section 329](http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=loi/fel/cea&document=part16&lang=e#sec329) of the [Canada Elections Act](http://www.elections.ca/content.asp?section=loi&document=part16&dir=leg/fel/cea&lang=e&anchor=sec329&textonly=false) (regardless of the size of my audience) and not broadcasting any election results until 2200h ET. But I&#8217;ll have live data pilfered from [cbc.ca](http://www.cbc.ca/) after 10pm.
