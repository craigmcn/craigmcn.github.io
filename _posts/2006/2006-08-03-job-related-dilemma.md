I&#8217;m in a bit of a job-related dilemma and I&#8217;m seeking advice. There are 3 jobs at stake:

<ol class="blog">
  <li>
    Technical Writer for a software/web development company.<br /> &#8211; good benefits, closer to home, more interesting work<br /> &#8211; I&#8217;d be the only technical writer, they have never had one before, so I get to make the rules<br /> &#8211; good interview, I think I&#8217;m in good shape for it, but not guaranteed<br /> &#8211; not making their decision until mid-next week
  </li>
  <li>
    Commercial Specialist for my former &#8220;team&#8221;<br /> &#8211; working with project team for a new Commercial Credit system<br /> &#8211; developing support materials<br /> &#8211; resolving escalated questions and issues<br /> &#8211; maintain &#8220;seniority&#8221; with the company and develop project management and technical writing skills<br /> &#8211; I&#8217;m the successful candidate and need to accept or decline the position this week
  </li>
  <li>
    Intake Specialist for my current &#8220;team&#8221;<br /> &#8211; this is what I do right now, but it&#8217;s a temporary position<br /> &#8211; I don&#8217;t really like it, but I know what I&#8217;m doing and I&#8217;m not too bad at it<br /> &#8211; this position is not yet posted and won&#8217;t be posted for probably 2 or 3 weeks<br /> &#8211; if I want to apply for this position, I need to decline job #2<br /> &#8211; this will be an open posting with no &#8220;preferred candidate&#8221; so there&#8217;s no guarantee that I would actually get the job.
  </li>
</ol>

My first thought is to decline job #2 and #3 and wait for job #1. My second thought is to take job #2. I&#8217;m pretty sure I don&#8217;t want to consider job #3, even though I&#8217;m doing it, I&#8217;m pretty frustrated with it and not interested in committing myself to a 1-year stint.

I want to take courses in technical writing; my current company will pay for the courses, or since job #1 pays a little more, I can afford to pay for the courses myself.

I want to move back to Saskatoon eventually, although I&#8217;m not sure I can enumerate my reasons other than affordable housing. If I choose to accept a job in Toronto, I would make a 1-year commitment with my current company or an 18-month commitment for job #1 and make a point of getting my expenses under control and saving for a larger down payment (and moving expenses). If I don&#8217;t take a job in T.O., then I would move back to Saskatoon within the next few months.

I&#8217;m interested in any feedback you want to provide &#8230;.
