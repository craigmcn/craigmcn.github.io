Nothin&#8217; much. Just realized that I used &#8220;It&#8217;s all over but the crying&#8221; for both posts about the ending of the Roll Up the Rim contest ([2006](/its-all-over-but-the-crying.html), [2007](/its-all-over-but-the-crying-2.html)). Kind of an odd coincidence, I think.

Other than that, this [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) thing seems to have taken off. I&#8217;ve found a bunch of people I never expected to see again, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll run into some more. But I&#8217;m still not sure what it&#8217;s all worth. Especially, what it&#8217;s all worth to the Facebook people. I don&#8217;t click on the ads, so how would they generate the necessary revenue to maintain such an impressive site?

It&#8217;s heads and shoulders above [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/) (if you ask meâ€”which few people do). It&#8217;s cleaner and easier to manage. I think that MySpace wins for having highly customizable pages. But the drawback for me in the customization is the terrible [HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/) and [CSS](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) support. Facebook doesn&#8217;t have any real customization tools, but the tools for finding and communicating with people, as well as for managing your own information are entirely user-friendly and intuitive.
