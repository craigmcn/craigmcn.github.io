So I mentioned in [my last post](music-monday-everything-i-do-i-do-it-for-you.html "Music Monday: (Everything I Do) I Do It For You") that I recently broke up with my girlfriend of just over one year. Well, she broke up with me. She dumped me. She wasn&#8217;t in love with me, something wasn&#8217;t 100% right, a few other issues. It&#8217;s sad, I&#8217;m sad, I&#8217;m hurt, I&#8217;m doubting myself, all kinds of other things are being affected by my feelings. I hate it.

I&#8217;m in counselling to try to resolve my issues. My biggest issue being that I&#8217;m doubting myself, my reasoning, my abilities, whether I&#8217;m looking for the right relationship, whether I&#8217;d know when I find the right relationship, whether I&#8217;m even physically in the right place for that relationship, and a host of other doubts relating to my life and my work. And, of course, my mind spins around these things all the time, settling them and then unsettling them.

I&#8217;ve realized that part of my problem is that for over a year this relationship was most of my life. It may be a bit clich√©, but she was my whole world. When I did something, it was the two of us. When it wasn&#8217;t the two of us, it was only because we&#8217;d agreed that the other didn&#8217;t want to go. My personal evening and weekend activities were mostly based on what I needed to get done before I spent the rest of my time with her. I always knew what was going at work, because we work together and we&#8217;d have coffee or lunch or walk home together and talk about everything. Now I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on and I don&#8217;t know what to do with myself.

So I&#8217;m opening up my world. I&#8217;m getting back into bagpiping. I&#8217;m going to see a guy about getting the bagpipes I haven&#8217;t played in seven years back into playing condition. I&#8217;m even thinking of spending some big bucks on electronic bagpipes and small, indoor bagpipes so I can do more practicing. My pal, Bryce, keeps talking about putting together a band, so that might be a fun thing to do. I&#8217;m going to a yoga workshop, maybe some regular stretching and meditation will help me clear my head periodically. And I&#8217;m going to just try new things, do things on my own, go to movies, concerts, art galleries, I don&#8217;t know what. Maybe even try dating like I should have in high school: talk to girls, go out for coffee or drinks or bowling or mini-golf; if it doesn&#8217;t work out, no harm done.

It still hurts and I miss her like crazy. I hope this feeling goes away some time.
