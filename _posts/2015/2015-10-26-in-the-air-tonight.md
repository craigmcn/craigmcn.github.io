This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_In the Air Tonight_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Air_Tonight) by [Phil Collins](http://philcollins.co.uk/) from his 1981 album, [Face Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_Value_(album)). The [Barenaked Ladies](http://www.barenakedladies.com/) version is from a 2015 episode of [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/search?feature_types=av-undercover).

I was just cruising [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/search?feature_types=av-undercover) season 6 and found a band a know covering a song I know. Seemed like something worth sharing.
