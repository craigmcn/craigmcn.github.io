Nothing huge, just a funny thing I read today. [Maclean&#8217;s](http://www.macleans.ca/) has a section called Upfront, and within the section, a sub-section called Scorecard. It&#8217;s four or five small items of the week that are either positive or negative. The first one is a negative this week: &#8220;U.S. military toyed with secret 1994 plan to create aphrodisiac sex bomb.Would make enemy soldiers irresistible to each other. Planners hoped &#8216;distasteful&#8217; result would sap morale. But what if drifting gas hit U.S. troops? Result could be &#8230; peace.&#8221; I laughed out loud about that!

And good news for movie-goers — in Toronto, at least — prices are on their way down. <del><a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/">Gwildor</a> forwarded me the link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bomb.</del>
