This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Cat’s in the Cradle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_in_the_Cradle) by
[Harry Chapin](http://harrychapinmusic.com/) from their 1974 album,
[Verities & Balderdash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verities_%26_Balderdash). The [Ugly Kid Joe](http://uglykidjoe.net/)
version is from their 1992 album, [America’s Least Wanted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Least_Wanted).

Another garbage cover. I can’t imagine why they would pick this song and brutalize it with their sound.
