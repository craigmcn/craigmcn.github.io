<span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, mono;">w00t!</span> I managed to score tickets to the [Toronto International Film Festival](http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000659/2005) to see a wicked new movie called [Thumbsucker](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/releaseinfo)! (Thanks, [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)!) What a good movie! I&#8217;d review it, but I&#8217;m too damn tired! I got RLP to come with me at the last minute, and after the show, we went over to the [Black Bull](https://plus.google.com/113996049186983725565/about?gl=ca&hl=en) for some bevys. I don’t know if it was the server or what, but the service was slow and surly. Anyway, this [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318761/) link provides good info about the movie<del>, as does the TIFF link above</del>.
