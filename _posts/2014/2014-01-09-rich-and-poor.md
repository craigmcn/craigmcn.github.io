Last week, my sister brought to my attention [an interesting article](http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/op-ed/Mixed+neighbourhoods+always+good+idea/9344177/story.html) about [socio-economically] mixed neighbourhoods.

I had some challenges understanding why &#8220;the supposed beneficiaries of social mix, the poor and marginalized, do not often end up as winners&#8221; and why &#8220;improvements in employment, income, educational outcomes, youth delinquency, and health are not achieved&#8221;, which the article didn&#8217;t really address.

I also had some really serious issues with the idea &#8220;that higher-income newcomers often use their political know-how and influence to fight against services for the poor&#8221;. Why would you choose to live in aÂ mixed neighbourhood if you&#8217;re not interested in the people who make it mixed? Moreover, how does the municipal political system allow _anyone_ &#8220;to fight against services for the poor&#8221;?

To me, this all seems to come down to some people feeling somehow more special or better than others because of money, or the ability to own a home, in this case.

If you choose to live somewhere, you choose to appreciate what&#8217;s there and make it yours. You don&#8217;t make it yours by making it something else altogether. If you want something else altogether, there&#8217;s probably already a place like that.
