It&#8217;s weird how [memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory) works. I was out for coffee with my friend Maki (who I haven&#8217;t seen in about 10 years) and I said something about her being [Mexican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico). I&#8217;m positive that she&#8217;s Mexican. But she&#8217;s not. She&#8217;s [Chilean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile). I _know_ she&#8217;s Chilean, but I&#8217;m _positive_ she&#8217;s Mexican. Why? Because somehow in my memory, one thing about her is more _real_ than another. She may be Chilean, but what I remember and what is more real to me is that she went to Mexico with her dad and brought me back a souvenir. For whatever reason this association with Mexico is more real to me than the fact that I know she&#8217;s from Chile. Very strange.
