For over a year now, I&#8217;ve been part of an unprecedented global call to action to end poverty: [Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/)

Right now, there is active campaigning in over 50 countries around the three core demands: More and Better Aid, Make Trade Fair, and Cancel the Debt. In Canada, we&#8217;re also campaigning to End Child Poverty in Canada.

You&#8217;ve just got to be a part of this campaign.

Go to [http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/) and sign on to the campaign yourself.

There is no time to lose. It doesn&#8217;t matter who or where you are, your voice is **critical** to the success of this campaign. This is a rare chance to join me and thousands of others across the planet to once and for all make poverty history.

What are you waiting for? [Join me and click in!](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca/) I have white bands and stickers, if you want them.

What you can do right **now**:

  * Sign on to the campaign
  * Tell federal MPs other politicians to commit to a timeline for 0.7%
  * Click others into action &#8211; forward this message to your networks

_&#8220;If everyone who wants to see an end to poverty, hunger and suffering speaks out, then the noise will be deafening. Politicians will have to listen.&#8221;_
