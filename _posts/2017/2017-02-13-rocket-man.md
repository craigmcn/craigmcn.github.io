This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Rocket Man_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Man_(song)) by [Elton John](http://eltonjohn.com/) from his 1972 album, [Honky Château](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honky_Ch%C3%A2teau). The [Iron Horse](http://ironhorsebluegrass.com/the-band/) version is from their 2007 album, [Classic Rock](http://ironhorsebluegrass.com/products-page/cds/classic-rock/).

I know I already shared this Music Monday a few years ago, but these are different videos and a different cover genre. Although, [Stewie is still the coolest](https://youtu.be/fi8MI7jjpSY).
