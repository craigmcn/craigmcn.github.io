Yeehaw! Monday morning! I have a little extra time this morning, since my shift is now 10-6. A month ago there were 4 of us doing the same job, now there&#8217;s 2. Excellent! What a way to manage attrition (good word, hey?) or employee turnover. (Not quite as good as a cherry turnover, but it&#8217;s all good.)

I had a sufficiently productive weekend. I&#8217;ve made some progress on crackerMail v1.1. I was asked to add an option to check all messages when selecting messages to delete, no problem. I wanted to add an option to sort the list by From, Subject or Received. It took a while, but finally I was able to steal some excellent code to do it. (I&#8217;ve acknowledged the authors from whom I stole code.) Except then the &#8216;check all&#8217; didn&#8217;t work anymore. So a little playing around, got it working again &#8230; except only in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank">Mozilla</a>, not <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx" target="_blank">IE6</a> &#8230; SONNUVA..! So a whole ton of playing around and almost rebuilding line by line, I got it all working. Very nice.

The game I told you about, where I couldn&#8217;t get past one of the missions, and <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> so kindly pointed out that **he** got past it &#8230; Well, I got past the mission and have done another mission. Now I&#8217;m a full level past where I was, I&#8217;ve leveled up all my skills. I&#8217;m now on my way to being a gunslinger. Except I think my talents would be better suited to being a coder &#8230; I&#8217;ll think about it. I have a really good time shooting dudes and then dropping them with an &#8216;overhand smash&#8217;. That&#8217;s where you boot them in the gut then smash down on their back with both hands and drive their faces into the pavement! Woo Hoo!
