Alrighty, I&#8217;m gettin&#8217; ready to go to the airport. The Yateser&#8217;s and A&M were tremendous hosts. It&#8217;s good to have friends who&#8217;ll let me have the run of their house, even I only see them every 2 or 3 years and exchange e-mails every 6 or 8 months.

Other than seeing the Yateser&#8217;s and A&M, I was highly looking forward to a visit with [wedding girl](/wedding-fun.html). We met up at the [Rose and Crown](http://www.roseandcrowncalgary.ca/index2.cfm) for drinks and had some great conversation. I was nervously anticipating a series of awkward silences, but apart from me stuffing my face with quesadilla, I think we talked the whole time. It was a nice hour. She&#8217;s an exceptionally busy person: she ducked out of a meeting early to meet me, then had to scoot off to another meeting after our visit, so I was lucky to get the time I did. She also mentioned that she might not be moving to T-dot quite as soon as she anticipated, and I might be moving West sooner than I anticipate, so I&#8217;ve got my fingers crossed. But I&#8217;m always willing to hear [what Red has in store for me](/hook-me-up.html) back in ToonTown, too.
