Okay, back in the Big Smoke! Good news for Wublub &#8230; I guess &#8230; he&#8217;s on his way to Saskatchewan &#8230; the land of cold winters and flat prairies (&#8216;I once watched my dog run away for 3 days&#8217;). So, I hope, I can take his job, since mine sucks fat goat ass.

I start my bartending course next week &#8230; I&#8217;m pretty excited! I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;ll be like, but I think it&#8217;ll be fun. If anything, it&#8217;s another skill learned. I was pretty good with the coffees at the café, so this should be similar.

I&#8217;m disappointed there were no responses to the post with the joke about René Descartes &#8230; did no one get it? Sorry, that&#8217;s it for now &#8230; I&#8217;m just waiting for my pizza, then some TV and off to bed &#8230; I&#8217;m beat!!
