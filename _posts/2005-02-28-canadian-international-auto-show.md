So, I&#8217;m fully auto-mated after my day at the <a href="http://www.autoshow.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian International Auto Show</a>. I went with my Uncle and Aunt who came in from London on the train. There was nothing I was really necessarily looking forward to, other than maybe the <a href="http://www.thesmart.ca/" target="_blank">Smart</a> car or the re-designed <a href="http://www.fordvehicles.com/cars/mustang/" target="_blank">Ford Mustang</a>. I was thoroughly disappointed by the fuel efficiency of the vehicles, especially considering that automakers had a huge chance to be proactive and jump on the <a href="http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.html" target="_blank">Kyoto Protocol</a> <del>(actually, read this or even this, they&#8217;re easier!)</del> bandwagon. Any manufacturer who voluntarily takes steps towards environmental stewardship is a hero in my book! But no, all the cars are the same old gas-guzzlers &#8230; especially the SUVs. There _was_ the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Escape#Hybrid" target="_blank">Ford Escape Hybrid</a>, but other than that it was the standard small car that was fuel efficient for the most part.

I picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Ultimate-Collection-Revolutions-Revisited-Animatrix/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1348163084&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Ultimate Matrix Collection</a> yesterday, so I watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234215/" target="_blank">The Matrix Reloaded</a> last night. I&#8217;ll probably watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242653/" target="_blank">Revolutions</a> this week some time. And then again several times in the future! What a wicked trio of movies! It even got me back in the mood to play the <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/" target="_blank">Matrix Online</a>, which was starting to bum me out a bit. I&#8217;m a &#8220;beta tester&#8221; (the non-disclosure agreement was lifted Feb. 14, so I can talk a little about it), and I was supposed to be playing mostly to help work out the bugs. I reported everything that happened to me and participated in the forums to discuss things a bit. But I was really just playing to have fun, and I was having a tough time getting into the game, because there was no story. But now that I have a fresh look at the original story, I&#8217;m having a bit better time playing the game.

So, bloggity blog blog &#8230; Stay Cool!
