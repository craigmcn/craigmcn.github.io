Fun times had by all at the [Saskatoon Ex](http://www.saskatoonexhibition.ca/). Well, not really. It appeared to be fun, in that there were lots of people and they all seemed to be enjoying themselves. But it was kind of a lame-ass affair. Same old rides as there always are, same old food, same old lame, aging rockers putting on a free show (yay, [Trooper](http://www.trooper.ca/)!), and the same old booths of weirdos flogging some [new, space-age, time-saving contraption](http://www.simplygoodstuff.com/rubber_brooms.htm). No thanks. Although the [elephant ears](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_dough) and [spudnuts](http://www.richland.tri-cityshopping.com/spudnuts/) are always yummy. And the [lumberjack show](http://www.westcoastlumberjacks.com/) was entertaining.
