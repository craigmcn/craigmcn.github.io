There is the possibility of a new job with my current company and the entire matter has thrown a spanner into my works. I was planning to finish my current job (12-month contract) and head &#8216;er back to [Saskamatoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon), but now that may not be the case. The job (as a web publisher) is exactly what I want and need right now. It lets me add to my resum√© web skills developed in a professional environment, rather than just at home fartin&#8217; around. I&#8217;m not guaranteed the job, but I&#8217;ve had 2 interviews. Now I&#8217;m just sitting and waiting for the outcome. Again, while it&#8217;s a perfect job for me right now, it puts my plans to move to [&#8216;Toon](http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com/) on hold for awhile. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s good or bad.
