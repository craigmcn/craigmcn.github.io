Not a huge list of things that are going to make my life infinitely better, nor make me a phenomenally better person. But kind of a huge list nonetheless.

My New Year’s resolution is to use a To Do list. And a calendar, I suppose. Keep track of the things that I want to do and set up a schedule to get it all done. Not done today or tomorrow, but eventually. And I fully expect that even as things get crossed off the list more things will be added, but all in all things will get done.

I’m going to try to use [Evernote](http://evernote.com "Evernote") more to keep track of things. I’m going to try to use [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com "Remember the Milk") more to remind me of the things I’ve decided to do. I’m going to try to use [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com "Dropbox") more to keep my files synchronized and accessible. I’m going to try to use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/ "Google Docs") more for quick, accessible documents, and my [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/ "Google Calendar") more to make sure I know what’s going on and when.

I think that should cover it, but I may find some other tools to help me along the way.
