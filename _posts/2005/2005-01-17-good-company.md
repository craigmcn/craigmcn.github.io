Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not perfect. &#8216;What!?&#8217; You ask, incredulously.&#8217;That&#8217;s not possible!&#8217; I know, I didn&#8217;t think so myself, but it&#8217;s now been proven. I noticed that somehow <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385267" target="_blank">In Good Company</a>Â was showing up in the Top Ten Movies as &#8216;Mpany&#8217;. At first, I thought it was some new foreign film, and was interested &#8230; But, no, sadly just Big Cracker&#8217;s error in programming and overlooking the possibility of data differing from the norm. It turns out that <a href="http://www.tribute.ca" target="_blank">tribute.ca</a> likes to screw around with their data sometimes (most likely to piss me off) and, of course, my little <a href="http://www.php.net" target="_blank">php</a> script didn&#8217;t expect it. That&#8217;s fixed now, as you can see. I&#8217;m sorry.

Oh, and now you can easily use HTML in your responses to my blogs, editorials and reviews with the fancy-schmancy new <a href="http://www.kevinroth.com/rte/demo.htm" target="_blank">Rich Text Editor</a> from <a href="http://www.kevinroth.com" target="_blank">Kevin Roth</a> that I&#8217;ve just implemented.
