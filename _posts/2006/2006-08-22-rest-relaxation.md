I&#8217;m on vacation. Man, oh, man, am I ever on vacation. I wake up about 8am, read &#8217;til 9-9:30, eat breakfast out on the deck around 10am, finish and come inside around 11-11:30am (after doing the [sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) in [the paper](http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/)). Then it&#8217;s time to [futz](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/futz) around with the ol&#8217; [laptop](http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2561), maybe practice the ol&#8217; [bagpipes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipes) a bit, watch some TV, do a couple more sudokus and have a sandwich, chips or other snack. By this time, it&#8217;s dinner time, again out on the deck. Then out for a short walk and watch some TV, then [the news](http://www.ctv.ca/ctvnews). Work? Huh? Oh yeah, I guess I&#8217;ll have to go back after a while. I&#8217;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.
