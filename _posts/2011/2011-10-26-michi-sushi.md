Sorry, I’m not accustomed to taking pictures of my food to share with people, so I don’t have a picture of my delicious Bento box from [Michi Sushi](http://www.michi.ca/ 'Michi Japanese Restaurant & Sushi Bar'). Salad, glass noodles, sashimi, tempura, teriyaki beef. Very tasty.

I have a picture of the Asahi beer, and the black sesame ice cream.

If I have any complaint, the teriyaki beef could have had more teriyaki sauce, but everything was terrific.

The service was excellent, and the servers easy on the eyes. I sat at the counter and watched the sushi chefs whipping up some excellent-looking dishes.

The next time any of you are in Regina, and interested in good, traditional sushi, try [Michi on Scarth Street at Victoria](http://maps.google.ca/maps?um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=michi+sushi+regina&fb=1&gl=ca&hq=michi+sushi&hnear=0x531c1e40fba53deb:0x354a3296b77b54b1,Regina,+SK&cid=0,0,2333158654736418115&ei=pVaoTuafGKPi0QGh7MCUCQ&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&ved=0CAUQ_BI).
