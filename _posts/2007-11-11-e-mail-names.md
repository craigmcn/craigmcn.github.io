Thanks everyone for the e-mail suggestions and votes. I was hoping to get some super-original names for which the dot com domain wasn&#8217;t already taken. After a little more research, I&#8217;m thinking of going with happySadMail, since I can get happysadmail.com, and it sounds kind of funny and silly, and like a bad translation from some other language. Plus I could always use the Comedy-Tragedy faces as a logo. Any thoughts?
