Boy, oh boy. Long weekends only manage to remind me of how much time I would rather spend not being at work. I mean, I saw 3 movies, almost read a whole book, finished almost all of the new [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/) pages, plus there were some beers and wings, a band at the bar, some video games and the ever-popular nap. All in all, quite an eventful weekend. And then, of course, back to work for the same old bulls&#8211;t!

The movies, you ask? [The Transporter 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388482/): excellent action movie! [The Brothers Grimm](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0355295/): very good; well-told story with dark cinematography, consistent with the Grimm Brothers versions of the fairy tales. I know [SmokeyB](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/) didn&#8217;t much care for it, but he&#8217;s wrong. And [Wedding Crashers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396269/): good movie; pretty funny for the most part, but the depressed brooding towards the end really killed it for me; and then it was over. My advice to future filmmakers: have a good ending. Movies that just stop can be fantastic the whole way through, but if the ending is shite, my opinion of the movie will be shite also.

And the book: [Eats, Shoot & Leaves](http://www.amazon.ca/Eats-Shoots-Leaves-Tollerance-Punctuation/dp/1592400876/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1347502846&sr=1-4) by Lynne Truss. Although Daddy-O isn&#8217;t much of a reader, I think he&#8217;d get a kick out of this book. It&#8217;s basically the history and proper usage of punctuation. It&#8217;s actually quite interesting and moves along quickly enough to keep me interested. I picked it up at the [Indigo Books](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/storeLocator/storeDetails/278/) after seeing Brothers Grimm. I wanted something to read while enjoying my [Grande Vanilla Latte](http://www.starbucks.com/menu/drinks/espresso/flavored-latte?foodZone=9999) at the [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.ca/).

Anyway, that&#8217;s all I have to say about that &#8230; Stay tuned for &#8230;. hmmm &#8230; that&#8217;s a good question. Sometime in the future there should be some more info. Oh, and I realize that the [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/craigmcn) is a little funky sometimes, depending on the aggregator you&#8217;re using, so I&#8217;ll see what I can do.
