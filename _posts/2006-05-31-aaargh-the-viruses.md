So, I&#8217;m on the phone with my niece walking her through scanning for viruses on her computer. Yes, right now, while I&#8217;m typing this blog. Come on, some of you have done tech support, you know that there&#8217;s plenty of time to be reading and typing and whatever else, while the caller does what they&#8217;re supposed to. We did some safe mode spyware killing, since the computer wouldn&#8217;t even boot. And now it boots and we&#8217;re checking for viruses. Good times!

I managed to beat the [TTC strike Monday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Toronto_Transit_Commission_wildcat_strike), since I took the day off work to hang with Mommy. What a fortuitous turn of events. That&#8217;s all I have to say about that.
