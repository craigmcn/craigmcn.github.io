Back to [Wall of Voodoo](http://www.wallofvoodoo.net/) for a quick interlude. This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Ring of Fire_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire_(song)), admittedly by [June Carter Cash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Carter_Cash), but made famous by [Johnny Cash](http://johnnycash.com/) in his [1963 single](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire_(song)). The [Wall of Voodoo](http://www.wallofvoodoo.net/) version is from their [eponymous 1980 debut EP.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Voodoo_(EP))
