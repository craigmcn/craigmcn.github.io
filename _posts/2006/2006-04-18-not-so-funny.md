Obviously no one was impressed with the funny video about how [the Easter Bunny hates you](the-easter-bunny-hates-you.html)&#8230; I thought it was pretty funny. That&#8217;s maybe something I need to work on &#8230; that maybe I find the wrong things funny. My sister didn&#8217;t even think the [&#8220;I peed in your cup&#8221;](too-much-coffee.html) was funny. I took it as a certain amount of self-deprecating humour, because I drink a ridiculous amount of [Tim&#8217;s](http://www.timhortons.com/en/index.html) coffee. Oh well, I&#8217;ll survive.

I got some excellent work done on the ol&#8217; [ppfhouse.com](http://ppfhouse.com/news/) website, because [LEO37](http://www.ppfhouse.com/leo37/) and the [Worst Pop Band Ever](http://wpbe.bandcamp.com/) have new albums coming out. In fact, WPBE has their CD release tomorrow night at [the Rex](http://www.therex.ca/)&#8230; come on out!

The [Western Cities Conference](http://www.westerncitiesconference.ca/) website that [Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and I are contracted to do is pretty much finished for now, with some updates coming later. I have to work out some [cron job](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crontab) issues to get it running optimally. (And some search engine optimization couldn&#8217;t hurt either.) It sure would be nice being able to do stuff like that full-time; I&#8217;m getting a little tired of being micro-managed. Plus then I might actually be able to solve the creative block I have with another site I&#8217;m trying to build.
