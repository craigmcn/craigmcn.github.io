Oh yeah, baby!! Friday night, opening night, I went to see the wicked, new, James Bond flick, [Casino Royale](http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/casinoroyale/site/)!! If I could whistle really loud, like with my fingers in my mouth, I would have. What a wicked movie! It&#8217;s such a different take on the [James Bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond) character and [Daniel Craig](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0185819/) does an excellent job of it. Although set in the present, it&#8217;s a prequel to the beginning of the James Bond character in Dr. No (1962). We get a clear understanding of Bond&#8217;s personality, his playboy style and why he&#8217;ll never hook up with [Moneypenny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Moneypenny). And, as always, Dame [Judi Dench](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001132/) does a super job of [M](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_%28James_Bond%29). 9 out of 10 saltines.

[Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) and I were supposed to go see the movie with (his sister-in-law) JAC and her friend, L, but due to a misunderstanding regarding a midnight showing of [Borat](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/borat/), they did not secure tickets. Unfortunate, but shit happens.
