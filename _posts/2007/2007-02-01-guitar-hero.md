I think [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) might get upset if I don&#8217;t mention this. I bought Gwilly&#8217;s [PlayStation 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2) from him (much to the chagrin of his brother; sorry bro&#8217;). I bought it just to play [Guitar Hero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_(video_game)) (1 & 2). My criteria for purchasing the game console (I have been shopping around) was to be able to get the console and Guitar Hero 2 (with guitar controller) for less than $200 (preferably tax included). I&#8217;m always on the trailing edge of Gwilly&#8217;s technology, mostly because I&#8217;m a cheap bastard. So it worked out well when GW decided to pick up an [Xbox 360](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/), for which Guitar Hero will be available in the very near future. Of course, for the 360, GH will be available for cooperative play via [Xbox Live](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/?WT.svl=nav) and will have downloadable tracks for expanded play capability, but I&#8217;m happy with what I&#8217;ve got.

My first impression: wicked. I had played one tune once at Gwilly&#8217;s place and done not too badly, then I played another tune another time and got slaughtered. Now that it&#8217;s mine I was expecting a similar learning curve. But no, right off the bat I whipped through _[I Love Rock &#8216;n&#8217; Roll](http://greatesthits.joanjett.com/lyrics/lyrics7.html)_ with no problem. Not fantastic, mind you, but very acceptable. I played another couple of tunes (on the Easy setting) and did alright. So I tried another tune on Medium. Whoo, boy, Medium is not Easy! On Easy you use 3 buttons one at a time, on Medium, you use 4 buttons sometimes 2 at a time. Very different level of complexity. I&#8217;ve now changed my play mode from Quick Play to Career, using Medium difficulty. It&#8217;s challenging, but it&#8217;s how you unlock new tunes. (I could always use Gwilly&#8217;s saved stuff, but I want to play the game as it was intended.) I&#8217;m moving up not too badly, but it&#8217;s not easy. I tried _[Fat Lip](http://www.last.fm/music/Sum+41/_/Fat+Lip)_ by [Sum41](http://www.sum41.com/) and _[No One Knows](http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/_/No+One+Knows)_ by [Queens of the Stone Age](http://www.qotsa.com/) and bombed! But I did surprisingly wicked on_ [Higher Ground](http://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/_/Higher+Ground)_ as done by the [Red Hot Chili Peppers](http://www.redhotchilipeppers.com/). Good Times!
