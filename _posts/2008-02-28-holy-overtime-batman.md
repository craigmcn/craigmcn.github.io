Just to let everybody know, I&#8217;m going to be super-duper busy for the next few weeks. The stupid company I work for has me on a project that involves ridiculous amounts of work over and above my regular work. &#8220;No worries, R\____ can take over some of your regular work.&#8221; Except, unfortunately (and with my sincerest condolences), R_\_\\_\_&#8217;s father passed away and R\_\___ will be in Poland for the next few weeks dealing with it. &#8220;No worries, K\____ will do all the design work.&#8221; Thanks, but that then puts me a week behind in getting started. And he&#8217;s only doing 5 out of the 18 screens. And then I get to work with someone else&#8217;s code.

I guess the silver lining is that it&#8217;s a bucket load of overtime. And I&#8217;m going to need the money when I quit my job and move back to Saskatoon. (Oops, did I say that out loud?)

I know it&#8217;s not a good idea to discuss my stupid employer in a public forum, but I don&#8217;t think the people reading this will really care. (Some of them are probably in full agreement!)
