</p>

I&#8217;m pretty sure I intended to get in touch with people and do something today, but that didn&#8217;t happen, &#8217;cause I&#8217;m a lazy ass. Boy, if you ever want to know how to be lazy, I can give lessons. They&#8217;d have to be short lessons, otherwise I couldn&#8217;t continue to be lazy &#8230; In fact, I would postpone the lessons for quite awhile to allow me to be lazy longer.

Today was Canada&#8217;s 137<sup>th</sup> birthday. Happy Birthday! You know, my dad mentioned one time about how it used to be called &#8220;The Dominion of Canada&#8221;, and how that was a really excellent, appropriate name. I wish it was still something like that. I mean, you&#8217;ve got the United Kingdom, referred to mostly as Britain or England, the United States of America, the U.S. or the States, but we&#8217;re just Canada. It seems a little plain. We could even be, and this would freak the Americans out, the Confederation of Canada. Well, here&#8217;s a toast to &#8220;peace, order, and good government&#8221;!
