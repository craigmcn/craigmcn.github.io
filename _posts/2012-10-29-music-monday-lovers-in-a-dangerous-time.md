This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Lovers in a Dangerous Time_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lovers_in_a_Dangerous_Time). The 1984 <http://brucecockburn.com/> original and the 1991 cover by the [Barenaked Ladies](http://barenakedladies.com/). I don&#8217;t know that I remember hearing the original before I listened to the cover on a weird self-published cassette tape, with a yellow photocopied insert, sometime in high school.
