Hey, everybody, I&#8217;m committed to putting an end to juvenile (type 1) diabetes by participating in the [Ride for Diabetes Research](http://www.jdrf.ca/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewPage&page_id=0D2634CD-0C72-2B6A-38820A33AADAED29). Juvenile (type 1) diabetes is the most severe form of diabetes. It is unpreventable and strikes infants, children, teens and young adults leaving them insulin dependent for life, facing a future of uncertainty due to the threat of developing devastating complications. By completing the secure on-line contribution form you will help accelerate the pace of diabetes research to find a cure.

Come on, everybody, help me out!

**Update (Sep 19):** Okay, everybody, [Smokey](http://bacon.frymybacon.com/)&#8216;s already donated. And if he can do it, anyone can!

**Update (Sep 22):** Seriously, people, I&#8217;m not even half way to my goal of \$100. All I need is for 10 people to donate 10 bucks each. It&#8217;s all online; you don&#8217;t even need to get out of your chair. Come on, how &#8217;bout it?

**Update (Sep 26):** Well, I&#8217;m a little disappointed in you guys. Mommy came through and bought the rest of my [chocolate-covered almonds](http://www.worldsfinestfundraising.com/go/?product/6902PE) &#8230; wait, sorry, donated enough to meet my goal. But I still think you guys need to step up.

Now that have a better idea of the event, I&#8217;ll fill you in. The idea is for a five-person team to ride a stationary bike as &#8220;far&#8221; as possible in 40 minutes. So, basically, each team member rides as hard as they can for eight minutes each. Considering I&#8217;m entirely out of shape, I did not too badly and made it 5.8 kilometres. The problem I was having was keeping enough tension to be able to maintain a strong, comfortable pace, but not so much tension that I was fighting against the bike. One of our guys had the tension a little to loose and was spinning out a lot. Our two strongest riders made 5.9 kms each, and our team overall made 28.2 kms. Among the five of us we raised $740, surpassing our goal of $550. And thanks to you guys, I managed to beat my $100 fundraising goal and raise $190! Plus, I got a picture of me kicking ass and being cheered on by a [Toronto Argos cheerleader](http://www.argonauts.ca/page/2012-argos-cheerleaders)!
