VeeDub&#8217;s comment on my [last post](/what-a-nice-weekend.html) reminded me that my sister mentioned that halfway through my [Excuuuuse me!](/not-so-funny.html) post, she only saw, &#8220;Blah blah cron job, blah blah search engine, blah blah blah.&#8221; So, I apologize about the technobabble, but that&#8217;s what interests me. VeeDub, I&#8217;ll have you know that I **do** know that TDC refers to [top dead center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Dead_Center) and has something to do with crankshaft position when the spark plug fires. And the nonsense about valves, I think you&#8217;re just makin&#8217; shit up, &#8216;cuz everyone knows you should be using a .006 feeler gauge on a Type 1 engine!
