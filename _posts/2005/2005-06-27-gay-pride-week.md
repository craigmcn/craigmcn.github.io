So this weekend was the [Gay Pride parade](http://www.pridetoronto.com/festival/parade-marches/), to conclude Gay Pride week. I have one question, though, when&#8217;s my heterosexual pride week and parade? I&#8217;m not trying to be a jerk, I know several gay people and they&#8217;re fantastic people. I just find it funny gays and lesbians feel the need to celebrate their sexuality publicly, while the rest of us suffer in silence.

In other news, h!, &#8216;leeeza and I went out for dinner to Lalot [restaurant] Saturday evening. Lalot has a great eclectic, asian-themed menu and a very minimalist decor. The location&#8217;s a little sketchy, but once you&#8217;re inside, it could be anywhere. h! knows the owner&#8217;s brother-in-law&#8217;s brother or girlfriend or I don&#8217;t know what. The connection was rather tenuous. But, in any case, we had a great time, with great conversation.

If anyone knows of any other great or cool restaurants in town, especially great chicken wing restaurants, let me know. I&#8217;m now quite eager to get to know great dining in the city.
