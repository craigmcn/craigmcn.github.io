I recently finished reading [Stephen King](http://www.stephenking.com/index.html)&#8216;s [11/22/63](http://www.amazon.ca/11-22-63-Stephen-King/dp/1451627289/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1349110210&sr=8-3), and loved it. Stephen King writes some great, creepy stories about killer clowns and rabid dogs and vampires and generally crazy, evil people. And to a certain degree this book is no different.

My sister&#8217;s taking an English class that focuses on monsters and covers your standards like Beowulf and Frankenstein. She chose as her essay topic Doctor Who&#8217;s Weeping Angels, monsters certainly, but not in the same scary, ugly, evil vein. This book&#8217;s scary, evil monster is time, specifically the past.

And &#8220;the past is obdurate.&#8221; The past resists change, aggressively. If you want to change a past event—and you actually have a time machine—the past, time, will put every obstacle in your way that you can think of. You&#8217;re driving? Flat tire. You&#8217;re sneaking around? Nosy neighbour. Whatever it takes to keep you from your destination. Which all makes for some great, suspenseful scenes.

It may not be the thing for die-hard fans of King&#8217;s work like _IT_, _Cujo_, _&#8216;Salem&#8217;s Lot_, _The Shining_ and _Misery._ But for those of us also love _The Dark Tower_ series, _The Colorado Kid_ and _The Green Mile_, I think you&#8217;ll be happy with it.
