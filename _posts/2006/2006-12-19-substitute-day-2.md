Question: How do you tell a group of trainees that what you&#8217;re teaching them will be used once in the whole time they do the job?

I spent a half-hour (thankfully, only a half-hour) on something that I only got one call about in 3 years of taking support calls. ([Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), Wublub: Cashflow Planning?) They&#8217;re a good group and ask pretty good questions. I&#8217;ve found some areas for improvements and provided some tips for them. I&#8217;m having a pretty good time.
