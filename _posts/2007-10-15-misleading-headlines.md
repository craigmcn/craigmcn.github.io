I just read an article with an entirely misleading headline, and what&#8217;s more, the DIGG community didn&#8217;t even catch on. The article refers to Hitachi&#8217;s breakthrough in hard drive size, announcing that 1- and 3-terabyte (TB) hard drives should be available by 2011. The headline announces that 1 TB iPods will soon be possible.

The giant magnetoresistance (GMR) technology that is the source of the breakthrough applies to magnetic hard drives with drive heads. GMR has no relevance to iPods, since they use solid-state flash memory and not standard spinning-platter hard drives.

I&#8217;m not super-tech-savvy and I even figured this out. I would think that technology writers, like ZDNet, and readers, like the DIGG community, would have caught this too.
