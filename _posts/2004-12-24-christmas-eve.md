Alright, it&#8217;s Christmas eve, I&#8217;m at work and, surprisingly, work sucks. As all of you are now well aware, I did not send out Christmas cards this year. Sorry. Life has been a little too hectic (and I&#8217;ve been a little too lazy) to get it done. I will be putting together a personalized email before the new year (I promise.)

The reason I just **had** to blog today was <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2004/12/23/festivus041223.html" target="_blank">an article</a> at <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/" target="_blank">CBC.ca &#8211; News</a> about a _Festivus_ celebration (of sorts) in Florida. Those of you who are <a href="http://www.tv.com/shows/seinfeld/" target="_blank">Seinfeld</a> <del>(I think you need Flash for this)</del> fans, like me, know that Festivus is a celebration &#8220;for the rest of us&#8221;. An aluminum pole replaces the decorated tree, and familial activities like &#8220;the airing of grievances&#8221; and &#8220;feats of strength&#8221; are featured. Good Times!
