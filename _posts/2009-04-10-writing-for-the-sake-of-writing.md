I&#8217;ve had a couple of ideas for posts over the past week or so, but they never seem to become substantial enough to write. So, here I am writing for the sake of writing. I guess it&#8217;s [Easter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter) time, springtime, time for renewal of sorts, maybe time to clean up (out) the house, maybe time to start gardening. I may do some of those things.

I had every intention of growing peppers and tomatoes and making my own salsa this autumn, but I think I&#8217;m already too late to get the peppers started this year. The garden, and the backyard in general, also needs some serious work this year, so we&#8217;ll maybe take this summer to get the backyard cleaned up and sorted out.

I got my bike over to the [Bike Doctor](http://www.bikedoctor.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=43) for a tune-up. I also asked for a new reflector on the back, new handlebar grips and a bell. I should be all ready for some good cruising this summer. I also have a 16-year-old mountain bike that could either be cleaned up or replaced. Not having mountain biked for seven years, I&#8217;m not sure how ready I am to get back into it, but we&#8217;ll see I guess.

Anyhoo, enjoy your Easter, ladies and gentlemen!
