This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_I Go Blind_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Go_Blind) by
[54-40](https://www.5440.com/) from their 1986 eponymous album,
[54-40](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/54-40_(album)). The [Hootie & the Blowfish](https://www.hootie.com/)
version is from a 1995 compilation album, [Friends (Music from the TV Series)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Friends#Friends_(Music_from_the_TV_Series)).

My partner learned of this cover version just today and was furious. Other than Darius Rucker on lead vocals, the cover version is essentially the same, adding no artistry whatsoever. If only for the opening riff, I agree, it could have been the same recording.
