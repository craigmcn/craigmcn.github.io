This week’s instalment of Music Monday is _’Zat You, Santa Claus?_ by
[Louis Armstrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong) from a 1953 recording. The [Buster Poindexter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Johansen#Buster_Poindexter)
version is from a 1987 single.

It’s Xmas time, so here’s an Xmas tune. I didn’t even know it existed until I heard it sung by some seven-year-olds at a school Xmas concert. Have a listen and try to imagine a grade two class singing.
