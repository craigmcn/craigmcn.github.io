But I’m going to keep plugging away and see how it goes. Here’s another, hopefully not the last, short excerpt from _The Minus Men._

> Mac also had a hired gun in Steve Wong. A big, muscular man with a shaved head and full beard, Steve was intimidating. He also had a fierce temper, a short fuse, and was always armed. Steve had worked with and for a few different criminal organizations, taking time every now and again to train with martial arts and other weapons experts. If you put an apple on your head, Steve had a way and a weapon that, from a few centimetres to a kilometre away, could take it off without you knowing. Steve preferred to use live targets, but he was content to practice with apples; he had never really liked apples.
