This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_This Flight Tonight_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Flight_Tonight) by
[Joni Mitchell](https://jonimitchell.com/) from her 1971 album,
[Blue](https://jonimitchell.com/music/album.cfm?id=5). The [Nazareth](https://www.nazarethdirect.co.uk/website/)
version is from their 1973 album, [Loud 'n' Proud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loud_%27n%27_Proud).

I recently found out that the riff for [Heart's Barracuda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barracuda_(song)) was inspired by the Nazareth cover, while Heart was touring with Nazareth. Mind blown.
