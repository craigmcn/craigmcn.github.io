Alrighty, I’m getting ready to head back to Saskatoon; just finishing up some laundry, packing, etc. I just got off the phone with my sister who called from our new house. Yay!

I was offered, and I took, a half day at work today. Cool, some extra time to get stuff done at home before I go away for a week. But, man, for the day it turned out to be, I’m not sure I want to come back. For some idiotic reason, there are 50 things that have deadlines over the next week, half of which involve me. I’ve had this time off booked for months, what kind of moron sets deadlines around the same time if I’m the one who has to do the work to meet them? What a bunch of retards. (Sorry, no offense meant to mentally challenged people; I’m sure they’re generally more thoughtful.)

Good thing I can get 8 hours worth of work done in 3 and a half!
