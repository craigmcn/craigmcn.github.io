I really appreciate all the excellent feedback about my [job dilemma](/job-related-dilemma.html). I&#8217;m a little surprised that the majority of you have such loose morals regarding taking a job and then fucking off within a couple of weeks. In fact, the guy who told me to apply for job #2 told me the same thing, and he&#8217;s a senior manager! One common thread was to contact job #1 and push them a bit, by telling them about the other offer. Already done and obviously unsuccessful, but good advice! Wublub had a good point about how since I don&#8217;t much care for the current company, why would changing jobs change my feeling toward them? Yeah, I don&#8217;t think it would. And those of you familiar with the current company were the first to tell me to dump at the first opportunity!

So, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve decided:

<ol class="blog">
  <li>
    I&#8217;ll let them know that I won&#8217;t be applying for job #3.
  </li>
  <li>
    I&#8217;ll tell them I&#8217;m interested in job #2, if they&#8217;ll give me a couple more days to make a final decision.
  </li>
  <li>
    If I can&#8217;t get more time, I&#8217;ll accept and wait to hear from job #1.
  </li>
  <li>
    If job #1 makes me an offer, I&#8217;ll take it and decline job #2.
  </li>
</ol>

Any objections?
