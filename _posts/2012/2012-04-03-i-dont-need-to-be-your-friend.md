excerpt: I remember a few gatherings of friends and feeling that I was expected to be friends with people who are very dissimilar to me, but are friends with the others, with whom I am also friends.

> Just because you and I are friends, doesn’t mean that I’ll like your friends, nor that I should be friends with them.

I think I was out with some friends and we were talking about some other people we know (or they know) and I felt as though I was expected to have wanted to be a participant in the situation being discussed. Maybe not.

I also remember a few gatherings of friends and feeling that I was expected to be friends with people who are very dissimilar to me, but are friends with the others, with whom I am also friends. I understand the situation, and I understand that it’s a very common occurrence, I just don’t really feel comfortable with it.
