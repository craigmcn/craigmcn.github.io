Wow! What a whirlwind weekend!! Okay, well, not really, I just liked the [alliteration](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=alliteration). Friday included a good game of [Balderdash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balderdash). We only managed to get through one game, due to the drinking, talking and smoke breaks. Then Saturday included [Settlers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlers_of_Catan), [Scattergories](http://www.boardgames.com/scattergories.html) and [Sequence](http://www.thehouseofcards.com/retail/sequence.html). But it started off with moving a full-size stand-up arcade game ([like this, sort of](http://www.ebay.com/itm/ARKANOID-STAND-UP-VIDEO-ARCADE-MACHINE-ROMSTAR-NICE-CLASSIC-/280951639921)) for [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), and was highlighted by a viewing of the wicked [V for Vendetta](http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/).

What an excellent movie. It&#8217;s a good thing that [Natalie Portman](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000204/) has grown up, I&#8217;ve been feeling slightly dirty since [The Professional](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110413/). And it&#8217;s a good thing that [Hugo Weaving](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989/) wears a mask through the entire movie, &#8217;cause I think it would&#8217;ve lost all credibility if [Agent Smith](http://matrix.wikia.com/wiki/Agent_Smith) or [Elrond](http://www.lordoftherings.net/film/cast/ca_hweav.html) had shown up halfway through. And, believe you me, that&#8217;s all I would&#8217;ve seen. I already had a tough enough time going from Smith to Elrond in [LOTR](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/). All in all, some great effects, a great story with some fun twists and a happy, yet sad, but entirely satisfying ending.
