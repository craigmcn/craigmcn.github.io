I could sure get used to this &#8230; I&#8217;m sitting at the picnic table in my backyard working on the laptop that&#8217;s running off the wireless router inside. There&#8217;s a beer and a bowl of &#8216;tater chips here and I&#8217;m loving life!!

I&#8217;m workin&#8217; on ol&#8217; [h! is for hulk](http://ppfhouse.com/art/century/)&#8216;s website and, man, why can&#8217;t I get a job doing this?

Anyway, I&#8217;m gonna head inside in a bit and have a couple of burritos, then I&#8217;m gonna head out to T&T&#8217;s for some poker.

Happy Easter long weekend!
