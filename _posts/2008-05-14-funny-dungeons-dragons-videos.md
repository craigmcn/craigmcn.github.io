So, chatting with my family the other day, I was mentioning some funny D&D spoof videos that I&#8217;d seen. It took me a while to track them down, but, for your enjoyment, here they are:

  * [Get a Life](http://www.myspace.com/video/arch-studios/get-a-life/3760481)
  * [Reno 911](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/911308/)
  * [Summoner](http://www.myspace.com/deathwish2090/videos/summoner/1040200)

I think they&#8217;re pretty freakin&#8217; funny.
