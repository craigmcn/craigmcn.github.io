So some of you are probably wondering where I&#8217;ve been all week &#8230; I&#8217;ve been trying to clean spyware and adware off my gorram computer! I installed a crack for some program and, of course, it installed a bucket-load of ruttin&#8217; adware and spyware. I finally used every piece of spyware and adware killer I could find, ran Windows in safe mode and it seems to have done the trick. I hope.

Other than that, nothing really new. I have a lot of communication to work on. I&#8217;ve been ignoring all kinds of people lately. Not on purpose, of course, but it happens. So I&#8217;ll try to get on it.

Enjoy yourselves!
