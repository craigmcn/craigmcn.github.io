Sorry, folks, this was supposed to be a Thoughtful Thursday post, but it&#8217;s become what I&#8217;ll now call Forgetful Friday.

Sometimes I know I&#8217;m being naïve, and I&#8217;m sometimes a little gullible. But I believe that comes from having a certain amount of trust in people, rather than not thinking critically about a given situation.

It&#8217;s good that I&#8217;m still writing this post today, because an example of this came up just last night over drinks with some good friends. I said I had to trust that [the program and service review at the university](http://craigmcn.ca/im-only-going-to-say-this-once.html "I’m Only Going to Say This Once") was fair and honest. I was told that, no, in fact, it should probably be questioned.

But I&#8217;m not in a position to know the actual financial situation of the university, nor the cost, efficiency or effectiveness of the programs and services. I trust that this data is being properly reviewed and assessed to come to fair and reasonable decisions about how to change. That may be naïve, and maybe I could find out these things and come to my own conclusions, but I trust in the process.

[I recently had a relationship end](http://craigmcn.ca/thoughtful-thursday-my-whole-world.html "Thoughtful Thursday: My whole world") and I was sad and angry for a long time (I still am, really). But I trust that the reasons I was given for the relationship ending were true and complete—at least as true and complete as they could be at the time. I trust that the &#8220;problem&#8221; wasn&#8217;t me and I accept (painfully) that there was nothing I could have done. I&#8217;d certainly like to believe that it was not an easy decision and that the loss I felt was reciprocated. Maybe I&#8217;m gullible, but I have to trust a person with whom I was in love. And in this case, I think it would demonstrate a significant lack of trust to investigate further.

Sometimes I know I&#8217;m being naïve, and I&#8217;m sometimes a little gullible. But I have to trust that the university or [Canada Post](http://craigmcn.ca/living-in-the-past.html "Living in the Past") or the government or people are acting in the best interests of everyone involved. And I know that often they&#8217;re not, they&#8217;re often acting out of blind self-interest or plain greed, and that&#8217;s often very apparent. And I&#8217;m well aware that the world is going to hell in a handcart. But without having a certain amount of trust, what kind of world are we making around ourselves?
