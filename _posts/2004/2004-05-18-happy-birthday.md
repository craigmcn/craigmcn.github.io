A quick note to say Hey, Howdy! And Happy Birthday to Gwildor! The big man is now 27 years old &#8230; still not as old as Big Cracker, but _nobody_ wants to be _that_ old!

I got my tax refund and the reimbursement for my wisdom tooth extraction, so I&#8217;m going to pay off my credit cards, pay down my line of credit and buy another computer. Why do I need another computer? I don&#8217;t. But as I mentioned at some point, my video card is not good enough for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Online" target="_blank">The Matrix Online</a>, so it&#8217;s time to upgrade.

I&#8217;ll get a bigger hard drive for this computer and use it as an all-purpose, all-around workstation. I&#8217;ve got the little IBM for PHP/MySQL web developing, and I&#8217;ll keep some space on this one for ASP developing. The new one will be for games, and I&#8217;ll try not to clutter it up with trash. Eventually, I want to get this one set up for moving all my old cassette tapes to digital format, and for editing my videotapes.
