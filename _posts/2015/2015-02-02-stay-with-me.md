This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_Stay with Me_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_with_Me_(Sam_Smith_song)) by [Sam Smith](http://samsmithworld.com/) from his 2014 debut studio album, [In the Lonely Hour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Lonely_Hour). Apparently, Sam Smith&#8217;s song was just a little too much like [Tom Petty](http://tompetty.com/)&#8216;s hit, [_I Won&#8217;t Back Down_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Won%27t_Back_Down), from his 1989 solo debut album, [Full Moon Fever](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Moon_Fever), that Tom and Jeff Lynne now have songwriting credit on Smith&#8217;s song. But Tom&#8217;s [cool with the whole situation](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/tom-petty-calls-sam-smith-song-similarities-a-musical-accident-1.2936254), and I&#8217;ll let you compare.
