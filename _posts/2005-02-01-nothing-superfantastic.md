Man, I did it again! Another week gone by with no blog! I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry. Actually, I&#8217;m not <span style="font-weight: bold;">too </span>sorry. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ve got emails piling up asking when I&#8217;m going to post another witty remark. So it&#8217;s not like you guys are really hurting for info. Or are you? Are you hurting? Really? I find that hard to believe.

Anyway, nothing <span style="font-style: italic;">super</span>fantastic this past week. <span style="font-weight: bold;">HUGE</span> congrats to <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and <a href="http://trikie.tripod.com/" target="_blank">Trikie</a> on purchasing their first home!! Also, I met Gwildor&#8217;s bud, <a href="http://bacon.frymybacon.com" target="_blank">SmokeyB</a>. Smokey is the Creative Director for <a href="http://www.frymybacon.com" target="_blank">Bacon Magazine</a>, which is a fancy way of saying that he gets free stuff by saying he works for a magazine. The magazine is him and his buddies, writing stuff to be able to get free stuff for writing about it. Smokey, if that&#8217;s not true, you let us know the truth &#8230;.

And Gwildor and I are back on the Online <a href="http://www.catan.com/" target="_blank">Settlers of Catan</a>. We got sidetracked by externalgateway.com, and rebuilding our sites after migrating to the new host. Gwildor got a new job, I couldn&#8217;t stand my job and now finally have a new job&#8230;. You know, all kinds of nonsense going on, we [involuntarily] put it on the backburner for a few months.

I finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Da-Vinci-Code-Novel/dp/0385504209/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346868147&sr=1-2" target="_blank">The Da Vinci Code</a> a couple of weeks ago, and am working on <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Beauty-Tips-Moose-Jaw-Travels/dp/0676976433/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346868116&sr=1-4" target="_blank">Beauty Tips from Moose Jaw</a>, reviews will be forthcoming. As will reviews for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374900/" target="_blank">Napoleon Dynamite</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375210/" target="_blank">White Noise</a>, the <a href="http://music.cbc.ca/#/bands/Bullmoose/" target="_blank">Bullmoose</a> show that I will attend Thursday and <a href="http://www.thekillers.co.uk" target="_blank">the Killers</a> new album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002858YS/002-0103006-3722438?v=glance" target="_blank">Hot Fuss</a>.

If you need anything from me, let me know, you just may get it. One of the girls at work (basically everyone I work with is a female between 5 and 20 years older than me, so they&#8217;re all girls) mentioned that she likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K52T/qid=1107311372/sr=2-3/ref=pd_ka_b_2_3/002-0103006-3722438" target="_blank">Marc Anthony</a> and if I know how to burn CDs. So I <a href="http://www.bitcomet.com" target="_blank">downloaded</a> the album and burned it. Well, now I&#8217;m a huge hero.
