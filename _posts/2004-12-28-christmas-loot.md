Christmas Loot!! Woo Hoo!! So, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all been sitting waiting patiently for a Happy Christmas blog from the Big Cracker &#8230;. Well, I guess, here it is. As most of you know, I&#8217;m moving, so I&#8217;ve been pretty busy, but not too busy for presents!

So, from Daddy-O, I got <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/2004/2/2/pentaxoptio30" target="_blank">an awesome digital camera</a>, from sis, <a href="http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=5657187&cart=221648021&style=music&Bab=E" target="_blank">an excellent CD</a>, from stepmom <a href="http://www.pageaday.com/catalog/preview_2005/0761134492.html" target="_blank">a calendar</a>, from my niece, <a href="http://www.sask2005.ca/merchandise/merch.asp" target="_blank">a wicked shirt</a> (not pictured on the page, but it&#8217;s wicked), from Mommy and stepdad, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002ZW92U/104-0207754-0854304?v=glance" target="_blank">a cool bar shaker</a> (kinda like the one pictured, but with another piece on the ouside that turns and gives you shakey drink recipes), <a href="http://www.pageaday.com/catalog/preview_2005/0761129898.html" target="_blank">a calendar</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0740746588/ref%3Dase%5Fdilbertcom-20/104-0207754-0854304?v=glance&s=books" target="_blank">a book</a> and cold, hard cash!

I was able to have a nice dinner with my uncle, aunt, and a friend of the family. Another aunt was supposed to attend, but she wasn&#8217;t feeling well. So my uncle and I went over Boxing Day and had a visit and dinner with her. Then I came home. The roads were good, but as always on the 401, there was reason to be stopped dead on the highway &#8230; this time for snow crews &#8230; I guess that&#8217;s _okay_.

I hope everyone else had a good Christmas, commercial and/or religious &#8230; &#8220;on earth peace, good will toward men&#8221; &#8230; &#8220;god bless us, everyone&#8221; &#8230; and my personal favourite: &#8220;Bah! Humbug!&#8221;
