This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is [_The Final Countdown_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Countdown_%28song%29) by [Europe](http://www.europetheband.com/) from their [1986 album of the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Final_Countdown_(album)). The [B&eacute;la Fleck](http://belafleck.com/)+[Abigail Washburn](http://www.abigailwashburn.com/) version is from a 2015 episode of [A.V. Undercover](http://www.avclub.com/search?feature_types=av-undercover).

The cover appeared on my Facebook feed for CBC Music and I thought it was fantastic. I was lucky enough to catch Béla Fleck at the 2011 [Saskatchewan Jazz Festival](http://saskjazz.com/).
