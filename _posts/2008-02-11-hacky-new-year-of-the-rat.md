After dealing with my site being hacked by someone posing as the Palestinian Hacker, I have less sympathy for the Palestinian cause. Given that I&#8217;ve generally felt that the State of Israel regularly (and quite literally) overstepped its bounds in asserting its sovereignty, to the great detriment of the Palestinian people, I&#8217;ve always felt at least a little sympathy for them. But if someone is going to use the name to hack my website, well, fuck &#8217;em!

Anyway, hackage resolved, I went for a small [Chinese New Year](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year) get together (a few days late, but no biggie). I visited with some very lovely people and ate some delicious food. In the spirit of ethnic diversity, I brought some delicious [Portuguese custard tarts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_tart#Portuguese-style).

Have a good one!
