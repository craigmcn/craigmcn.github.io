So, when I travel, I usually have some expectation that things will be different wherever I am. For example, that stores will have different products; in fact, that there&#8217;ll be different stores. Or that I&#8217;ll get wonderful, helpful service at these wonderfully different stores. Why is that? I mean, why would I think that?

The reason I ask, is that I went to [Darcy McGee&#8217;s Irish Pub](http://www.primepubs.com/#/whats-on/?id=132) in [Sparks Street Mall](http://www.ottawaplus.ca/portal/profile.do?act=print&profileID=46969&sectionID=) and received exactly the service I&#8217;ve come to expect. I sat at the bar and received my [Harp Lager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp_Lager) rather quickly. But that&#8217;s always misleading. I was not asked if I wanted a menu, nor was I asked if I wanted to have another beer before I finished the first one. Once I asked for a menu and another beer, the bartender was nice enough to suggest a menu item, but then never came back to ask me what I wanted to order. So I left.

But I did manage to get a fantastic meal at the [Brig Pub](http://www.thebrigpub.com/) in Byward Market. I had some delicious spring rolls and a wicked steak with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables. Plus a nice [Creemore Premium Lager](http://www.creemoresprings.com). Which reminds me of my less than spectacular visit to the [Highlander Pub](http://www.highlanderpub.ca/). It was advertised as a Scottish pub with traditional Scottish pub fare. I found nothing overly Scottish about the menu and, sitting at the bar, I wasn&#8217;t particularly entertained by the rows and rows of Scotch bottles. At the Brig, I managed to watch some of the Toronto-Buffalo hockey game; at the Highlander, nothing but Scotch! Even what I got from the menu wasn&#8217;t great. It was some kind of chicken pot pie, but the chicken was obviously just a cut-up breaded chicken cutlet tossed into a chicken broth that had about 4 potatoes, 7 carrots and a celery or two. Not impressive.

What was impressive was the service I got at the [Starbucks](http://www.starbucks.ca/) (yes, I know, I&#8217;m going to hell for frequenting the Starbucks so much).They suggested a multitude of options and I settled on a [Peppermint Mocha](http://www.starbucks.com/retail/nutrition_beverage_detail.asp?selProducts=128). Funny how I have difficulty spending 5 bucks on lunch, but have no problem spending it (plus a tip) on a cup of coffee! And the only reason I ended up at the Starbucks was because the [Beavertails](http://www.beavertailsinc.com/) guy only took cash and I needed to run over to the cash machine, which was on the far side of the Starbucks from the Beavertails. [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) told me I needed a beavertail, so I got one for dessert.

Whew. That was my visit to Ottawa. It&#8217;s only Saturday morning and I don&#8217;t catch my train until lunchtime, so I&#8217;m going to see if I can go on a tour of the Parliament buildings. The tours are offered daily starting at 10am. So if they&#8217;re not too long, I&#8217;ll take the tour then head over to the train station. I&#8217;ll let you know how things work out&#8230;
