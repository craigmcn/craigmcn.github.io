So, I&#8217;ve basically been told that all the work that our department has done over the last 3 or 4 (or more) years is entirely user-_un_friendly and the people who put it together (i.e., the people with whom I work) are morons for having put things together the way they are now.

We have a giant new project to completely overhaul the entire site layout (and presumably the content, too), so the project is planning to make some much needed changes. Changes that had been toyed with 2 years ago, but never got off the ground because there weren&#8217;t people to make it happen. Plus, for the last long while, the people who actually do the work have been held back by managers who love to say no.

So, sure, now those managers are gone and there&#8217;s money and people to get a giant project going. So now we get to do the right thing. But don&#8217;t make it look like everything we&#8217;ve done for the last 3 or 4 years was wrong and stupid just because it&#8217;s not as clever as it can be now.
