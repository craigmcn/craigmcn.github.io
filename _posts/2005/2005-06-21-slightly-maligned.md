Alright, I&#8217;m trying to get more than 1 blog per week, and I&#8217;m on day 6 already. I first have to apologize to Daddy-O, since he felt slightly maligned in my blog from June 7. He read-in some sarcasm (and rightly so, my Woo hoo! was definitely facetious, bordering on sarcastic) that he felt was unnecessary. I did enjoy myself painting his fence and mowing his lawn while I was on vacation, but I felt my readership would find that to be a little too much work for a vacation, and so felt the need to add a qualifier.

It&#8217;s been a pretty good week. I need to apologize as well to h! is for Hulk. I have only just begun to get to work on some major updates to his [website](http://www.ppfhouse.com/). The changes are substantial and will involve a freakin&#8217; ton of work, but I&#8217;ll get it in the next few days. Of course, there has to be some time for [MxO](http://www.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/) and [CoD](http://www.callofduty.com/)! I also have a couple of scripts I want to write for my own site. I have a photo gallery script I&#8217;m working on, and I have a small Javascript pop-up script to finish.

I went to a wedding this past weekend, my cousin, Princess Fiona, and her new husband, Shrek. They make a lovely couple. I definitely don&#8217;t _want_ to offend anyone, but I feel the need to &#8220;tell it like it is&#8221;: the MC had no personality and the speeches were uninspired. Other than that, it was a good time: a beautiful church, excellent weather, a gorgeous bride and handsome groom, the bride arriving in a horse and carriage (&#8220;Love and marriage go together like a &#8230;&#8221;), family, friends, dancing, music &#8230; Good Times!
