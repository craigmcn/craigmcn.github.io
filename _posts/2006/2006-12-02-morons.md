&#8220;That&#8217;ll be $8.77, please.&#8221; &#8220;Okay, debit.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, sorry, our debit machine&#8217;s not working. Do you have cash?&#8221; Ummm, no? Why would I use debit for $8.77 if I have the cash? I can maybe understand using a credit card if there&#8217;s points, but debit? Idiots!
