You may be wondering why I’ve been writing so many posts lately, and I’m going to tell you. As I mentioned yesterday, I’m using [Typingweb](http://www.typingweb.com/) to improve my typing. I also need to practice using the skills I’m learning.

Hopefully, I’ll get to the point where I can type at least remotely quickly enough that typing will be as easy as writing with pen and paper. I have a novel I’d like to write, but it is too much hassle trying to do it.

So there’ll be plenty more posts on the way!
