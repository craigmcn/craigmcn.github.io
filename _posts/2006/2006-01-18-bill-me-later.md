Sonnuva..!! Every year the same thing! The day comes for me to renew my domain, but I don&#8217;t get any notification and don&#8217;t have an invoice to pay until it&#8217;s already expired!

You may have noticed the site down for most of today, so did I. Then I realized what day it was, so I logged onto the billing site and lo and behold! my invoice was ready to be paid.

I have asked to billed a few days before, from now on &#8230; we&#8217;ll see what happens next year.

&#8230;. Ahhh &#8230; [someone](http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,70041-0.html) after my own heart !

&#8230;. And &#8230; [someone](http://www.theonion.com/content/node/44458) after [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s!
