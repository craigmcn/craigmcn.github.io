Sorry, everybody, I&#8217;ve spent the last few days feeling nothing but contempt for the human race. From drivers who don&#8217;t pay attention to pedestrians and honk like idiots all the goddam time, to smokers flicking their cigarette butts everywhere, to selfish, pushy jerks on the subway and bus.

So, since I&#8217;ve been downloading ridiculous amounts of TV lately, I&#8217;ve been reminiscing with season 3 of [Quantum Leap](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096684/), catching up on the last couple of seasons of [Charmed](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158552/) (gotta love the hotties!), and getting an introduction to [Six Feet Under](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248654/). Not to mention keeping up with season 3 of [Deadwood](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348914/). This keeps me out of public areas where people piss me off!

Plus I made a wicked burrito filling concoction of seasoned ground beef, refried beans, Mexican-style rice and sweet corn niblets. I ran out of large tortillas and had to make do with the small ones, so I made a kind of tortilla pizza. Delicious!
