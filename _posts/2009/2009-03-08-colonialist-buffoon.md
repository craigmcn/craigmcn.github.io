I managed to identify myself tonight as a colonialist [buffoon](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/buffoon). I attended, as I do fortnightly, Trivia Night at the [Yard & Flagon](http://www.yardandflagon.ca/home) <del>(I would link, but there&#8217;s nothing good to link to :-()</del>, and a question came up about [Mount Kilimanjarno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilimanjaro) [sic]. I made some comment about [Kēnya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya), for which I thought I was being rather [erudite](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/erudite), and was ridiculed, because it should be pronounced Kĕnya. Alas, more the fool me. Apparently, Kēnya is the British colonial pronunciation, while Kĕnya is correct, native pronunciation. Now you know!

**Update 2012-08-02:** (Yes, three-and-a-half years later) I was just reviewing some of these old posts and found that this post originally referred to the Yard & Firkin, which it is not. My apologies to the Yard, its staff and its patrons.
