So, here we are on day 5 of being back on the phones and I finally remember what sucked so much ass about it. It&#8217;s not that the callers are imbeciles (which they are), or that the questions are the same (which they are). It&#8217;s that there is a short down-time between each call (that is, sometimes there&#8217;s not another call waiting immediately after the last one) that isn&#8217;t long enough to focus on anything else. I had to restart this blog 3 times before I knew enough about what I was going to say to be able to be interrupted 14 times and still say it. Day 5 and I&#8217;m almost ready to start killing people.

Oh, and [Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) stopped by the office today. Everyone was so happy to see Mr. [Geek Squad](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/geeksquad.aspx) in his fancy jacket and tie pin.
