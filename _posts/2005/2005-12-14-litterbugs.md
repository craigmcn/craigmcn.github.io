I have a big issue with litter. I mean, just hang on to your trash until your get to a garbage can. Is it really that hard? But I can understand litterbugs. Fine, throw your crap on the ground, whatever. It&#8217;s the secret litterbugs that bother me. People who know they shouldn&#8217;t litter, but don&#8217;t want to be seen littering. So make like they just happened to let something fall from their hand as they were walking, but didn&#8217;t notice so they didn&#8217;t pick it up. Grrr.
