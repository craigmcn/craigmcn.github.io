This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Rolling in the Deep_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_in_the_Deep) by [Adele](http://adele.com/) from their 2011 album, [21](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_(Adele_album)). The [Linkin Park](http://linkinpark.com/) version is from their 2011 album, [2011 iTunes Festival in London]().

I searched for &#8220;folk covers&#8221; and somehow ended up with &#8220;nu-metal covers of pop songs&#8221;. Good enough.
