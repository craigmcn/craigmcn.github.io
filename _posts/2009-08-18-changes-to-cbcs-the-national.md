I would like to alert you to a disturbing situation concerning CBC&#8217;s The National.  It was recently uncovered that a small circle of senior managers at the CBC has quietly developed a plan to move the public broadcaster&#8217;s flagship news program The National from 10 pm to 11 pm on weeknights. See this news story: <http://www.friends.ca/news-item/8554>.

While CBC management has denied the existence of the plan, recent experiences on key matters such as placing ads on CBC Radio and changes to Radio 2 have seen senior CBC officials regularly contradicting themselves.

There is a meeting of the CBC Board of Directors coming up soon.  Can you please take a few seconds to sign a petition asking the Board to reject any proposed changes to The National?  Here is the link:

Thanks!
