So I&#8217;m sitting at the lunch table in the caf&#8217; and one of the girls mentions that her son needs a haircut, but doesn&#8217;t want to go to old Lou, his regular barber. Of course, like a man, he doesn&#8217;t want to ask his buddies who they go to: [in a stereotypical gay lisp] &#8220;Hey fellath, who doeth your hair? It&#8217;th fab-u-louth!&#8221; (Sorry, JoeyJack, no offense intended.) But, really, what&#8217;s the big deal? Obviously, you don&#8217;t want to position it like that, but try something else: &#8220;Yo, dude, where d&#8217;you get yer haircut. My guy charges too much and does a crappy job.&#8221; Is it really so bad? Or am I a fool?
