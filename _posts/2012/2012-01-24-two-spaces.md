A [grammar blog](http://btr.michaelkwan.com/2012/01/20/grammar-101-the-internet-changed-everything/ "Grammar 101: The Internet Changed Everything") I read the other day reminded me of a [Slate post](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/01/space_invaders.html "Space Invaders") from a couple of weeks ago about the practice of adding two spaces after a period when typing. [Farhad Manjoo](http://www.slate.com/authors.farhad_manjoo.html "Farhad Manjoo"), the Slate author, has very strong opinions on the subject, and even consulted typographers for clarification. I checked with the [Modern Language Association](http://www.mla.org/style_faq3 "Modern Language Association") (MLA) website, which provides a non-prescriptive answer.

I’m not sure I have any strong opinions on the subject. The standard in my English class last year was two spaces, and I did what I was told. Although, personally, I tend to follow the web standard, which solves the problem for me. The [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML "HTML") [specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html "W3C Specification") is to collapse all white space when rendering inter-word spacing; meaning that spaces between words (e.g., from a period to the next word) will be collapsed to one space. Easy.

Generally, [modern typography and technology resolve issues](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_spacing) that arose from monospaced text on typewriters, allowing for a return to the original rules of typeset typography.

I don’t usually solicit feedback on my thoughts, but this time I will. What do you guys think about spaces after periods?
