A large number of issues have come up in the last week that have challenged my efforts to [ignore things](http://craigmcn.ca/greed-self-interest-ignorance.html 'Greed, Self-Interest and Ignorance'). It all brought to mind an issue that has been with me for a long time now: the frustration of extreme arguments.

Ideally, the argument against &#8220;Yes&#8221; is &#8220;No.&#8221; And vice versa. But all too often the extreme argument only gets a soft-hearted, moderate response. &#8220;Abortion is murder!&#8221; &#8220;A woman&#8217;s health is her business.&#8221; &#8220;Homosexuality is a sin!&#8221; &#8220;Live and let live.&#8221;

I&#8217;m frustrated when I&#8217;m faced with an extreme argument and have no response except to say, &#8220;Umm… you make a [possibly] reasonable argument, but I don&#8217;t agree.&#8221; At this, almost invariably, I&#8217;m presented with another long list of reasons why I should agree or why the situation exists, but my answer doesn&#8217;t change, I still don&#8217;t have any rebuttal.

There have been a few times when I&#8217;ve had to just stop the discussion altogether because I&#8217;m not contributing and really only being berated for my opinion. And other times when I&#8217;ve been left speechless by the irrationality of a strong opinion against which I can&#8217;t argue because it&#8217;s so far outside of what I would expect from otherwise intelligent people.

Today, I may have started something I can&#8217;t finish trying to stand against such an irrational, strong opinion, because I&#8217;d hate to see the opinion become a _de facto_ policy out of sheer lack of interest. It goes against ignoring things, but I&#8217;m trying to be the best I can be.
