I&#8217;ve been meaning to mention this for about a day and a half &#8230; I won a very close [Scrabble](http://www.scrabble.com/) game Tuesday night. I had to take a <a href="https://dv8b8dkxht4vb.cloudfront.net/img/scrabble-060822.gif" data-fslightbox="lightbox">picture of my winning board</a> just to show some of the wicked words that got used. Like Daddy-o&#8217;s 54-point &#8220;[question](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/question)&#8220;, hitting double letter and triple word squares (and using the 10-point Q), And my fine 33-point &#8220;[zeal](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zeal)&#8220;, with the 10-point Z sitting on a triple letter square. Yes, thank you, congratulations **are** in order!
