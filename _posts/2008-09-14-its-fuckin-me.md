First, I&#8217;ll warn you, [this is slightly offensive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPdFrW076R0)&#8211;okay, maybe totally offensive&#8211;to some, but HI-larious all the same. It reminds me of [another tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGB7iLpVrhQ) that is equally hilarious.

**Update:** I fixed the links. Why didn&#8217;t anyone mention they were broken?
