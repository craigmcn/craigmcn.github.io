Another week? You&#8217;re kidding? How did that happen? Not a whole lot to say about this week, while I got some things done, it wasn&#8217;t much. I watched the Canada for Asia benefit on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/" target="_blank">CBC</a> Thursday night. It was an excellent show, if only because <a href="http://www.bluerodeo.com" target="_blank">Blue Rodeo</a> performed. And that was my week. Pretty sad.

But I did find out about an interesting &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a contest or a poll or just what it&#8217;s supposed to be &#8230; on <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/radio/" target="_blank">CBC Radio</a> called 50 Tracks with <a href="http://www.jian.ca/" target="_blank">Jian Ghomeshi</a>. How much do you want to bet that <a href="http://www.fruvous.com/" target="_blank">Moxy Früvous</a> will not make the list? For those not _in the know_ like me, Jian Ghomeshi was the drummer for Moxy Früvous!

Oh, and you&#8217;ll notice from the response to the last blog, that Prairie Vixen found me. That is actually monumental news. We&#8217;ve been playing email tag for the last 2 years. Yes, 2 **years**! We were good friends back in Banff, but we&#8217;ve both moved and only barely keep in touch. But now that she&#8217;s found me, maybe we&#8217;ll keep in touch better &#8230; ?
