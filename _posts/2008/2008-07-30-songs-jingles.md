Can someone please explain how I got Neil Diamond&#8217;s _[Brother Love&#8217;s Traveling Salvation Show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCgeWUKcumA)_ stuck in my head?

Yesterday it was the [Ferryman&#8217;s Funeral Home](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WKRP_in_Cincinnati_episodes#.22A_Commercial_Break.22_.283.2F26.2F79.29) jingle from WKRP in Cincinnati, but I know where that came from. I saw a Virgin Mobile poster that said something about “plans made to love”.
