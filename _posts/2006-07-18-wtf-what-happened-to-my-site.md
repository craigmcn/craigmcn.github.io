Holy site change, Batman! What do you think? I&#8217;ve been fartin&#8217; around with it for the last several weeks and finally got the [CSS](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/) doing what I wanted. Most links should still work, [let me know](mailto:craig@craigmcn.ca) if they don&#8217;t.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> All the little bits and bobs that were on my home page (e.g., movies, lotto numbers, NHL and CFL stats) will all end up under <a href="shared.php" rel="nofollow">Cracker&#8217;s Stuff</a>, but it&#8217;ll take another couple of days to clean it all up.
