Alrighty, I invite all of you to present some obscure piece of Canadian trivia. Here&#8217;s mine:

Samuel Hearne walked almost 3,500 miles (“the equivalent of the distance as the crow flies from Gibraltar to Moscow” *****) in almost 19 months (December 7, 1770 &#8211; June 29, 1772) from [Churchill, Manitoba](http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=16751278121685971473,67.816666,-115.083336&time=&date=&ttype=&q=churchill,+manitoba+&ie=UTF8&ll=57.480403,-99.272461&spn=8.113,20.566406&z=6&iwloc=addr&om=0) to the [mouth of the Coppermine River](http://maps.google.ca/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&time=&date=&ttype=&q=kugluktuk,+nu&ie=UTF8&ll=64.491725,-102.304687&spn=13.07555,41.132813&z=5&om=0), searching for the [North-West Passage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_west_passage). <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">* Newman, Peter C., <em style="font-size: 1em;">Company of Adventurers</em> (p. 357) Penguin Books, 1985</span>

The reason I posted this is that Friday night I was out with some folks and the question was asked: “When was Louis Riel?” And, of course, I answered, 1870 in Manitoba (which was then the Red River Settlement) and 1885 in Saskatchewan (which was then the North-West Territories). I was asked why I knew that, and my answer was, “Because it&#8217;s Canadian history and worth knowing.”

So. Show me what **you** know.
