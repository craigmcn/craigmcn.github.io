Not much to tell you, I&#8217;m still trying to track down freelance work. Using Twitter, I&#8217;ve found [RentACoder](http://www.rentacoder.com/RentACoder/DotNet/default.aspx) and [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com/w/), and somehow I found [eLance](http://www.elance.com/). I can&#8217;t claim any success with them yet, but I&#8217;ll let you know.

I&#8217;m already behind on a blog post on TheTechWriterBlog.com, but it&#8217;s in the works and should be up later today. I&#8217;ll probably back-date it to Friday and try to get another post done today.

Right now, I&#8217;m taking a look at affiliate marketing programs. I&#8217;m going through the details of [Amazon](http://www.amazon.ca/)&#8216;s [Associates Program](https://associates.amazon.ca/) right now. (I&#8217;ve signed up, but they still have to approve me.) Basically, I get paid a percentage of whatever people buy from Amazon, if they access it through the link on my page. I&#8217;ve also looked at [ClickBank](http://www.clickbank.com/index.html), but I&#8217;m not completely sure I understand it.

So that&#8217;s where my self-employment stands. If you have any ideas for anything more I might do, technical writing blog topics or Amazon products to blog about, [let me know](mailto:craig@craigmcn.ca).
