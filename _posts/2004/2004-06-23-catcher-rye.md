I just finished reading The Catcher in the Rye for about the eighth time. What an excellent book! I first read the book 13 years ago, when a friend of mine gave it to me to read while I was on a student exchange to Germany. I loved it. I even wrote a paper on J.D. Salinger when I was in grade 12.

If you haven&#8217;t read it, the story is about and is narrated by Holden Caulfield. Holden&#8217;s not much of a student and has now failed all his classes and is being kicked out of Pencey Prep, a private boy&#8217;s school. Holden doesn&#8217;t really want to stick around at Pencey, now that he&#8217;s flunked out, and since Christmas vacation is coming up in a few days, he decides to head back to New York City (where his family lives). He doesn&#8217;t go home right away, because he doesn&#8217;t want to confront his parents about having been kicked out of school and because this isn&#8217;t the first time. So Holden gets himself into a couple of adventures in New York. Some things are a little unbelievable, since Holden is only 16 years old, but it&#8217;s all good fun.

The story was written in 1947, and although some of the language is a little &#8216;old-fashioned&#8217;, a lot of it is still very much in use today — making it still very easy to read. And I think it&#8217;s easy enough to relate to, for most people: a disaffected youth who mostly finds everything and everybody annoying. Holden even calls a female friend of his a &#8220;pain in the ass&#8221; to her face, which really doesn&#8217;t go over well.

I&#8217;ll leave you with two quotes that I really think define the book:

> He took another look at my hat while he was cleaning [his fingernails]. &#8220;Up home we wear a hat like that to shoot deer in, for Chrissake,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a deer shooting hat.&#8221;
  
> &#8220;Like hell it is.&#8221; I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was taking aim at it. &#8220;This is a people shooting hat,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I shoot people in this hat.&#8221;

> &#8220;You know what I&#8217;d like to be?&#8221; I said. &#8220;You know what I&#8217;d like to be? I mean if I had my goddam choice?&#8221;

> &#8220;You know that song &#8216;If a body catch a body comin&#8217; through the rye&#8217;? &#8230; I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody&#8217;s around — nobody big, I mean — except me. And I&#8217;m standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff — I mean if they&#8217;re running and they don&#8217;t look where they&#8217;re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;d do all day. I&#8217;d just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it&#8217;s crazy, but that&#8217;s the only thing I&#8217;d really like to be. I know it&#8217;s crazy.&#8221;
