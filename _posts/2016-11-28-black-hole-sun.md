This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Black Hole Sun_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hole_Sun) by [Soundgarden](http://www.soundgardenworld.com/) from their 1994 album, [Superunknown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superunknown). The [Postmodern Jukebox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCORIeT1hk6tYBuntEXsguLg) version is from a 2016 performance.

I was just futzing around in the youtubes and stumbled on the Postmodern Jukebox channel. I'd seen it before, but kind of forgotten. I think I could do Music Mondays for a long time from this channel!
