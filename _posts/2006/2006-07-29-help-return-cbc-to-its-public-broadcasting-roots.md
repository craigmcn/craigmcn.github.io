The recent decision by the [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/)&#8216;s management to pre-empt [The National](http://www.cbc.ca/programguide/program/the_national) and present a [US reality show](http://www.tv.com/shows/the-one-making-a-music-star/) demonstrates that the CBC has lost sight of its public broadcasting mandate in a rush for ads and eyeballs.Â  The fact that the [American Broadcasting Company (ABC)](http://abc.go.com/) has [cancelled The One](http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/07/28/the-one-cancelled.html) due to extremely poor ratings shows the disturbing amount of control CBC management has ceded to executives in Hollywood.

Just weeks ago. the Conservative government decided to postpone a review of CBC&#8217;s mandate. It is obvious that we can wait no longer. Please visit:

Send a letter to your MP, asking her or him to contact Prime Minister Harper to demand that a CBC mandate review take place now.
