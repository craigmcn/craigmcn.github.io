So I made a quick stop into the Parliament Buildings for a tour. But my breakfast took me longer than I expected, so I didn&#8217;t get there until after 10:00am. The first tour was right at 10:00am, and the next not unitl 10:50am. The 45-minute tour would have taken me to 11:35am (did you get that math right?) and I still needed to check-out of my hotel (and actually get back to the hotel from Parliament Hill) and get to the train station for just after 12:00pm. So I just took a look around, went up the Peace Tower to the Memorial Chamber and up the elevaor to the Observation Deck. I only took a couple of pictures (well, maybe just one) while in the Tower and they weren&#8217;t too good.

Anyway, the real story I want to tell is about the 90-year-old woman a few seats ahead of me on the train. When we got  to Kingston, she asked if she should get off the train, since she lived in Kingston. The woman sitting in front of her asked if she was supposed to get off in Kingston, the older woman said yes, but that we weren&#8217;t supposed to get to Kingston until 6:00pm, and that&#8217;s when her friend was to pick her up. The woman in front asked to see the older woman&#8217;s ticket (to make sure whether she was supposed to go to Kingston). The ticket showed Toronto. So the woman in front told the older woman that her ticket was for Toronto. &#8220;Then I go to Kingston?&#8221; &#8220;Hmmm, let&#8217;s ask the conductor.&#8221; At this point, the train is pulling out of the Kingston train station. The conductor comes over, &#8220;No, dear, you&#8217;re going to Oakville. Your daughter spoke to us and said that you&#8217;re going to Oakville and that your friend is going to pick you up there. Someone will come for you when we get to Toronto&#8221; &#8220;Oh, okay.&#8221; Waaahhh!!

If I&#8217;m old and can&#8217;t travel well by myself, write a little note to me so that I know what&#8217;s going on, or don&#8217;t let me travel by myself. I don&#8217;t want to be riding on a train that&#8217;s pulling out of the station I want to get off at only because I didn&#8217;t know enough to get off.
