Another woman&#8217;s first name. I know I&#8217;ve [already posted](/jolene-dolly-parton.html) Dolly Parton&#8217;s [_Jolene_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolene_(song)), but I also wanted to include it as a cover, because there are some great covers out there. I like [The Little Willies](http://www.thelittlewillies.net/) ([Norah Jones](http://www2.norahjones.com/)) version, which seems a little more desperate than the original, but for some reason I prefer [The White Stripes](http://www.whitestripes.com/)&#8216; angrier version, with [Jack White](http://jackwhiteiii.com/)&#8216;s crazy vocals.
