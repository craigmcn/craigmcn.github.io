Yeah, it was nominated for and won some [Academy Awards](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/awards), obviously my review is coming a little late. I had every intention of seeing it in the theatre, and it seems to me that I was one of the first to get behind it. Anyway, that&#8217;s all in the past, I have now seen the movie, and it was spectacular!

I definitely appreciate [Toni Collette](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001057/) in a role where she&#8217;s not downtrodden and depressive. [Steve Carell](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0136797/) is very good in a somewhat more cerebral role than usual, and [Greg Kinnear](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001427/) plays fairly serious with a touch of comic relief. I&#8217;m not sure [Alan Arkin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000273/) deserved the Oscar for Supporting Actor: while his character is pretty good, he&#8217;s not in the whole movie and his character&#8217;s influence is not driven by the acting, it&#8217;s just part of the story.

The family leads a bit of a hard-knock life, but they seem to be getting by well. [Abigail Breslin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1113550/)&#8216;s character, 7-year-old Olive Hoover, is intelligent, open-minded and has a very healthy self-image. The story tells about the pitfalls the hard-knock family encounters while trying to get Olive from their home in [Albuquerque, NM to Redondo Beach, CA](http://maps.google.ca/maps?saddr=Albuquerque,+NM,+United+States+of+America&daddr=redondo+beach,+ca&f=d&hl=en&sll=35.125525,-106.634674&sspn=0.558228,1.2854&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=6&om=1) for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant.

I think the best part for me (and this might be a bit of a spoiler, so I won&#8217;t go into too much detail) was some obvious commentary about the questionable nature of the pageant. All of the 7-year-old participants are presented as implicitly sexual, with lots of make-up and revealing bikinis and gowns. Even their talents tend to have a certain sexuality as well. But Olive&#8217;s talent performance is overtly sexual and the audience is outraged. The hypocrisy is HI-larious!

8 out of 10 saltines. Very good, lots of fun. <del>Here&#8217;s a funny SNL sketch featuring  &#8220;Abigail Breslin&#8221;.</del>
