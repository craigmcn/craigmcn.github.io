I was out with a very random group Saturday afternoon and we all generally shared the same opinions. A database programmer in his mid-thirties, a former firefighter and EMT and current construction contractor in his late thirties, a city-dwelling farm couple in their mid-eighties, and me discussing the idiots around us.

To be honest, I don’t entirely recall the discussion. I had intended to write this post immediately upon coming home, but only got the first paragraph done. I then chose to move onto eating dinner and snacking while watching _[Moneyball](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/ "Moneyball")_.

But regardless of the content of the discussion, it revealed to me that I’m not alone in my complaining. It’s also probable that I surround myself with people who share my world view, thus reinforcing my view, and adding further frustration with those people and situations that frustrate me. Unfortunately, I don’t intend to change.
