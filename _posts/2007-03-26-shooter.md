Since I generally have little better to do on a Sunday afternoon, I went to the movies. The big-ass [Paramount](http://www.toronto.com/movies/listing/100419) (now the [Scotiabank Theatre](http://www.cineplex.com/Theatres/TheatreDetails/Scotiabank-Theatre-Toronto.aspx)) is within walking distance of my bagpipin&#8217; space and I wandered down to see what was playing. There wasn&#8217;t much, but I&#8217;d heard some good things about [Shooter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0822854/), and it was playing fairly shortly, so I went.

As you might expect with an [Antoine Fuqua](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0298807/) movie, there was plenty of shooting and killing and explosions. Good times! The political intrigue was not as intriguing as it could have been. It doesn&#8217;t take much to convince [<span style="color: #800080;">Mark Wahlberg</span>](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000242/)&#8216;s character, Bob Lee Swagger, to take on a fairly suspicious project, but he makes the comment that all they have to do is mention &#8220;patriotism&#8221; and he&#8217;s good to go.

All in all, a little predictable. Super-duper good guy is framed for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit, so he becomes a one-man army to redeem himself. Of course, no mention is made of how he pays for all the fancy-pants equipment he ends up with, but I guess a little creative licence is to be expected.

7 out of 10 saltines, fun, worth watching, but you can always wait for the rental in 2 months.
