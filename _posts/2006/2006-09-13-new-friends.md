I just found out that both [VeeDub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/) and Jock have websites. So now I&#8217;ve added 2 new friends to my menu. VeeDub&#8217;s got an old junker &#8217;59 VW Beetle that he&#8217;s hotrodding. ([Boyd Coddington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyd_Coddington), here&#8217;s some competition for you!) And Jock will become a daddy in about 7 months, so he&#8217;s documenting his adventure over the next few years. Doc&#8217;ll be doctoring pretty solid for awhile, so I guess she&#8217;s leaving the hard work to the big man! (Just kidding, I have nothing but respect for working parents; that&#8217;s who raised me and did a damn fine job.)

Oh, and VeeDub, once you&#8217;re done, you can hook me up with a <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Volk_bus_1968a.jpg/800px-Volk_bus_1968a.jpg" data-fslightbox="lightbox">cool &#8217;68 van</a>.
