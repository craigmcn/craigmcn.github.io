Alrighty, well, you&#8217;ll notice that my _Enough of Not Enough_ (RealTorontoSolutions.ca) stuff has been removed. Actually, I&#8217;m just including it in my latest [Editorial](/paul-wells-back-page.html). I&#8217;ve been working on this editorial for the last few days &#8230; obviously, I&#8217;m not the prolific writer I thought I could be.

Other than that, I was helping Daddy-O work on his [website](http://rscdssask.org/). I&#8217;m hoping to get those frames outta there &#8230; not because they don&#8217;t look good, but because they&#8217;re generally frowned upon. I think getting some [PHP code](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp) in there would help Dad keep the consistency that the frames provide.

I&#8217;m going to get back to the editorial and hope to have it up today &#8230; hey, no jokes about “getting it up!”
