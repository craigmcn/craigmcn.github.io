Okay, I&#8217;m disappointed that there were no responses to the last blog. But, hey, I know you&#8217;re all busy, busy people. I just want to mention that I&#8217;ve got kind of a big post on the go, and I was hoping that it would be ready this morning, but I&#8217;ll get it finished for tonight. I haven&#8217;t forgotten my loyal readers!

**Update:**
  
Sure, yeah, my sister has to post something today and prove me wrong&#8230; Indeed, there are responses to the last post!

So you should see the new Jazz link on the left&#8230; I have a review of last night&#8217;s Love Orchestra gig at <a href="http://www.therex.ca/" target="_blank">the Rex</a>. What a great show! You can post responses to that as well.

I&#8217;m working on a message board &#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll just grab a forum from somewhere, rather than screw around with it myself. I&#8217;m also going to add some new stuff to the Jazz area, hopefully, like a schedule of cool stuff going down around town. Maybe if Santo wants to get involved, we&#8217;ll get Jazz in Saskatoon, too.
