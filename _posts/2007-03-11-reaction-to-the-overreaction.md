So, thinking more about [Friday&#8217;s incident](/holy-overreaction-batman.html). I think I have a better understanding of some of the issues I have with drivers. Jackass mentioned that I should go around his car. To me, this is a common attitude of drivers (I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s the attitude of **all** drivers, but it&#8217;s prevalent.)

Understandably, pedestrians are more maneuverable than cars. But that&#8217;s no reason to assume that we want to maneuver. Yes, I _can_ go around you, but why? &#8216;Cause you can&#8217;t think to stop _before_ the crosswalk? &#8216;Cause you&#8217;re inching your way out of a driveway and need to stop on the sidewalk? &#8216;Cause you&#8217;re completely oblivious to the concept of people walking through a parking lot (especially since you&#8217;ll be in the same position in a few seconds)? Pay attention!
