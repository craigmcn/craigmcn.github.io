So we had some big announcements at work yesterday. It had been part of my goal or career path or what-have-you to become a Business Specialist. Well, in the interest of _efficiency_, that position will no longer exist after November 1 (the beginning of fiscal 2006). The existing 10 positions are being replaced by 4 positions elsewhere in the _business model_. Have you ever noticed how _efficiencyÂ _seems to mean someone loses their job? Not that this is necessarily a bad thing. I think it will solve some problems that would otherwise not be solved, namely duplication of work, which is inefficient. But still, making a process more efficient always seems to include some unemployment. Well, hopefully I won&#8217;t be around long enough to see this happen.
