Okay, everybody, I&#8217;m whipping out another [fancy AJAX survey](/a-new-domain.html). I don&#8217;t exactly know what I intend to do with the results of the survey, but I&#8217;ll let you know. (And for those of you joining us from [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), you&#8217;ll have to view the original post to see the survey.)

If you&#8217;re not aware of my wicked, kick-ass, web-based e-mail program crackerMail, take a moment to read about it. I created crackerMail with the intent of being able to access fully my multiple e-mailboxes from one handy-dandy place, with no restriction on the computer or firewalls. It works like a charmer, for the most part (there&#8217;s always something that can be upgraded), and I love it.

The problem is that it needs a more [politically correct](http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-552) name. So, I&#8217;m asking you guys to hook me up with a cool name.
