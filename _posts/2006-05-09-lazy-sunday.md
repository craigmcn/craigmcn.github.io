So I stole the title from the [HI-larious SNL digital short](http://www.nbc.com/Video/videos/snl_1432_narnia.shtml), which still makes me laugh out loud, but it&#8217;s sort of the reason why it&#8217;s already Tuesday and I haven&#8217;t mentioned my non-stop, action-packed, rollercoaster, thrill ride weekend. Actually, it was only Friday night, I went to see [Mission Impossible 3](http://www.missionimpossible.com/home.html). It was pretty good. As I said, non-stop, action-packed, etc. But [J.J. Abrams](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/) seemed to almost parody the [original MI](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117060/) with some cheesy rehashing of some similar action sequences. Definitely a must-see, the new characters and decent acting make for a solid film.

Other than that, wicked quiet weekend that included watching some DVDs while tidying my house and cleaning my bathroom (grr-oss!). I also duded up the site with some fancy new RSS formats. Why? Why the hell not! Actually I was cleaning up the script that builds them, so I can implement them on wublub&#8217;s site.

By the way, if anyone has any comments re: [my resum√©](http://www.craigmcnaughton.ca/), I&#8217;d love to hear &#8217;em!
