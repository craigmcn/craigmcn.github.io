I’m trying to get back into blogging, or at least writing every now and again about the things going on in my mind. I’m very interested in both minimalism and productivity, so I’ll try to focus on those topics.

I’ve chosen to restart my writing on a new (to me) blogging platform that is both minimalist and productive. My old blogging platform was something I built myself and needed a lot of work to get it to do what I wanted, and so I stopped using it. While I wouldn’t necessarily call Tumblr minimalist, I can keep the displayed elements to a minimum. It also allows me to view and update posts on my smartphone, productive capability that I wasn’t having much success building myself.

I’ve redirected bigcracker.ca, including the blog archives page and RSS feed, to my Tumblr homepage, so this is now all there is. You’ll see these updates in [Facebook](http://facebook.com/craigmcnaughton) and on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/craigmcn), keeping my posting to a single source (minimalist and productive), and yet allowing me to stay active on all three.
