Kinda cool. I got to the ride the subway through the old &#8220;ghost&#8221; subway station, [Lower Bay station](http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5006.shtml)Â [_scroll down a bit_]. There&#8217;s some tunnel repairs going on right now and Upper Bay station is closed, so trains are being routed through Lower Bay (trains are not stopping at either Upper or Lower Bay). It was kinda dingy and really just looked like it was being used for storage, but it was still kinda cool. I believe it was used for the movie [Mimic](http://imdb.com/title/tt0119675/), with the sultry and sexy [Mira Sorvino](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000227/).
