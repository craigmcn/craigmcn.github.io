Whew! Late night, last night!! In fact, early this morning &#8230; I got in about 3am. (Thanks to Shuttergirl for the ride home!) I went out to [Sneaky Dee&#8217;s](http://www.sneaky-dees.com/) to watch RLP (Shuttergirl&#8217;s fiancé) shred some wicked guitar! He played 2 tunes, backed-up by Montréal&#8217;s [Bullmoose](http://www.myspace.com/bullmooseband), then the &#8216;Moose played 3 or 4 tunes. The line-up also included [The Exchanges](http://www.myspace.com/theexchanges) (very excellent), San Francisco Treat (also very excellent) and [Kill the Lights](http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/kil/bio.asp) (kinda alright). The show was for the birthdays of The Exchanges&#8217; drummer (whose name I no longer recall) and some girl (who I don&#8217;t recall at all). I have the flier somewhere &#8230; hmmm &#8230; nope.

  * The Exchanges were good and loud. The lead singer looks a little like [Casey Affleck](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000729/). I liked their stuff.
  * San Francisco Treat was loud and sounded a lot like [The Clash](http://www.theclashonline.com/), which I really liked.
  * Kill the Lights were good, but sounded too much like [Franz Ferdinand](http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk/) for my taste. Also, the name reminded me of <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.leoslyrics.com/listlyrics.php?hid=rOF%2FLnaBUuE%3D">Hit the Lights</a>, by [Metallica](http://www.metallica.com/), so I was looking forward to Metallica and got Franz Ferdinand &#8230; a little disappointing.

Other than that, I&#8217;m getting closer to getting the apartment all organized. Maybe I&#8217;ll have a housewarming &#8230; 3 months later! I don&#8217;t think I mentioned the mouse in my apartment &#8230; I saw him within the first few days after I&#8217;d moved in and once or twice a few days later. So I put down 4 traps and nothing happened. When  I tidying up to move all my stuff out of storage, I put away 3 of the traps, the 4th was behind some boxes, so I left it. Well, I moved those boxes this weekend and, lo and behold! there was mouse, almost cut in two! Ha! So I put the mouse and the trap into the trash.
