This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Clocks_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clocks_(song)) by [Coldplay](http://coldplay.com/) from their 2002 album, [A Rush of Blood to the Head](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rush_of_Blood_to_the_Head). The [Old School Freight Train](https://www.facebook.com/Old-School-Freight-Train-10304489590/) version is from their 2005 album, [Pickin' On Coldplay: A Bluegrass Tribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_School_Freight_Train#Albums).

I was just searching for &#8220;folk covers&#8221; and found this. It seemed fun and cool.
