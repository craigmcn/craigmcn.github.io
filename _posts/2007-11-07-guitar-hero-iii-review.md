Woo hoo!! It&#8217;s been a week with [Guitar Hero 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero_III:_Legends_of_Rock) and the wireless guitar and I&#8217;m definitely happy with the investment. To be fair, the [soundtrack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_in_Guitar_Hero_III:_Legends_of_Rock)&#8216;s not spectacular, but now even non-[Xbox 360](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_in_Guitar_Hero_II#Main_setlist) players get some [Pearl Jam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_Flow) and [Iron Maiden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Number_of_the_Beast_%28song%29), and now we all get some [Metallica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_%28Metallica_song%29). I&#8217;ve managed to finish the game on medium (and five-starred it!) and I&#8217;m in the middle of hard. I got massively stuck on the guitar battle with [Tom Morello](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Morello), so I went back to five-star medium. I&#8217;m past him now and a little worried about facing Slash.

I really like the guitar battles, both in the career and multiplayer play. I don&#8217;t much care for the cutscenes after finishing a section. I have seen most of most of them, but I really don&#8217;t see the need for them. In Guitar Hero 1 and 2, you simply moved on to bigger venues, I think that&#8217;s all that I want to do here. I don&#8217;t need a whole narrative around my career. And I love the wireless guitar. Being more mobile and not have to worry about where I am and what the cord is knocking over or getting caught on is really helpful.

**8 out of 10** saltines. Damn you, Tom Morello!
