Okay, <del>so while Wublub&#8217;s joke was pretty funny</del>, I&#8217;m still mostly disappointed with the execution of Saddam Hussein. He&#8217;s definitely not the first world leader to have ordered mass murders in a paranoid delusion of personal security and retribution. He&#8217;s not the first to order the deaths of political opponents or ethnic or cultural minorities. But he&#8217;s certainly one of the few to be executed for it. I&#8217;d put together a list, but I&#8217;m not sure it would be conclusive. In my opinion, the U.S. forces who captured him should have exiled him on their own. Iraq is not in a stable enough political position to have treated the trial fairly and impartially. The need for vengeance was far too strong to allow for real justice.
