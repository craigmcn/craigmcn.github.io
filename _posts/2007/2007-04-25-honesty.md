I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see this title and think, &#8220;Ooh, someone lied to poor Big Cracker and he&#8217;s professing a policy of honesty.&#8221; Or, I suppose, &#8220;Big Cracker lied to us and now he&#8217;s coming clean.&#8221; Nope, none of the above. I&#8217;m just qualifying today&#8217;s <a href="/rutr.php" rel="nofollow">Roll Up the Rim</a> entries. I&#8217;ve logged them as extra large, but one was really medium and the other large. The Tim&#8217;s location I go to is nearing the end of its cups and providing an empty extra large cup to anyone buying Roll Up-qualifying beverages (of smaller sizes). So, although I only purchased and received medium and large coffees, the winning rims were in fact on extra large cups. This also partly confirms that the more expensive cups have more winners. 2 extra large, 2 winners, hmmm.

It&#8217;s a shame I don&#8217;t have last year&#8217;s bet with [VeeDub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/) this year. He wagered that I couldn&#8217;t get more than 5 winners last year, and he won. This year, it&#8217;s 7, woo hoo!

Oh, and just a note for those of you that get my RSS feed via Google Personalized Homepage, I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s got my last post with the title &#8220;Am Ia Blogger?&#8221;, there is definitely a space between the I and the a.
