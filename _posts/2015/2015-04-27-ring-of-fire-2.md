For my good buddy, Ben, this week’s instalment of Music Monday is once again [_Ring of Fire_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire_(song)), made famous by [Johnny Cash](http://johnnycash.com/) in his [1963 single](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire_(song)). The [Social Distortion](http://www.socialdistortion.com/) version is from their [eponymous 1990 album](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Distortion_(album)).
