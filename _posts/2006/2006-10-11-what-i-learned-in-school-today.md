I was reading some material for work and felt the need to get some information about &#8216;that&#8217; versus &#8216;which&#8217;, because of course good ol&#8217; [Microsoft Word](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/support/?av=zwd) told me the grammar was incorrect. Now, I have [Fowler&#8217;s usage guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler's_Modern_English_Usage) at home, but unfortunately I&#8217;m not at home. So I Googled &#8220;that which&#8221; and found [Jack Lynch](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/)&#8216;s site at [Rutgers](http://www.rutgers.edu/) that [explained everything](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Writing/t.html#that) (true, it&#8217;s American, but I believe it applies generally). I like learning.
