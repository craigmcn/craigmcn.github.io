This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Ain’t No Mountain High Enough_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain%27t_No_Mountain_High_Enough) by
[Marvin Gaye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Gaye) and [Tammi Terrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammi_Terrell) from their 1967 album,
[United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_(Marvin_Gaye_and_Tammi_Terrell_album)). The [Diana Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Ross)
version is from her 1970 album, [Diana Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Ross_(1970_album)).

We’ve started learning the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell version in choir, and the Diana Ross version was mentioned, so I thought I’d check it out and share.
