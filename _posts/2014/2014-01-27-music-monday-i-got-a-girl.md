This week&#8217;s instalment is [Devin Cuddy](http://www.devincuddy.com/bio.html)&#8216;s I Got a Girl from his 2012 album, Volume One. [The Devin Cuddy Band](http://www.devincuddy.com/) opened for [Blue Rodeo](http://bluerodeo.com/) last week and I was quite impressed. If I hadn&#8217;t been, I would&#8217;ve imagined that he was only there because [his dad](http://www.jimcuddy.com/) let him.
