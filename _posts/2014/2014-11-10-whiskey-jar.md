This week&#8217;s instalment of Music Monday is _[Whiskey in the Jar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_in_the_Jar),_ an early and popular version by [The Dubliners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dubliners), from their 1967 album, [More of the Hard Stuff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_of_the_Hard_Stuff). The [Metallica](http://metallica.com/) version is from their 1998 album, [Garage, Inc.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garage_Inc.) I heard the Metallica on [the radio](http://www.98cool.ca/) last night and thought it was kind of a weird song for them to cover. And the video&#8217;s a little ridiculous, too. Enjoy.
