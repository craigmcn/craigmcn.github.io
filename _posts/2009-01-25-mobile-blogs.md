Because I was having some problems posting blogs from [my fancy phone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q9c), I decided to do something about it. Rather than try to re-vamp the fading technology (I have some serious work to do to bring it back up to my discriminating standards already), I decided to write a quick and easy script that let me email my posts. The posts won&#8217;t have embedded links (e.g., Big Cracker; although I will be able to add something like http://www.bigcracker.ca/ and have it work properly), and I&#8217;m still looking at being able to add images to the posts, but it works like a charmer!
