With the migration of all my blog posts from bigcracker.ca and craigmcn.tumblr.com, I&#8217;ve been reviewing all the posts for broken links and adding new [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) [metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata) to them.

This has allowed me to review the thoughts and experiences I had [5, 6, 7, 8](http://youtu.be/LBBqOTd5qzE) years ago. What was surprising to me—although, maybe not surprising to you—was that my views and opinions of people and the world have been fairly consistent over the years.

Drivers, traffic, transit, pollution, the environment, music, movies, comedy, you name it, my opinions have not changed dramatically since 2004.

Is this good or bad? I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s mostly just an observation. But I think it fits with my opinion that consistency is good.
