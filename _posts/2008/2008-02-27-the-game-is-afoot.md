A foot? WTF? No, no, [afoot](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/afoot). It must be some old hunting phrase; the animal (game) walking or running (afoot) rather than sitting.

Anywho, the game I&#8217;m talking about is [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/) [Roll Up the Rim](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/index.php?homepage) contest. Monday, I got my first (non-winning) large coffee. Tuesday was number 2, in more ways than one.

Once again, for the 4th year, I&#8217;m keeping track of my stats, and I set it up so others can keep track, too. (I still need to update the page a little, but it&#8217;s fully usable.)

Good luck!
