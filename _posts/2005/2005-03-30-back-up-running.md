Oh yeah, baby! The &#8216;puter is back up and running! WOO HOO! I don&#8217;t think I can explain just how much I need a functioning computer in my life. [Email](http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/), [internet](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/), Freecell, oh, and the actual work that gets done (hardly ever!). I can&#8217;t seem to live without it. And you know why? Do you? No? Let me tell you &#8230; there is fully shit on TV! I can&#8217;t watch that crap all night! Well, actually there is some good programming, but it is eclipsed by so-called Reality Shows. Come on, there&#8217;s nothing Real about [Survivor](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/), [Fear Factor](http://www.nbc.com/Fear_Factor/), [The Apprentice](http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice_2/), [American Idol](http://idolonfox.com/) &#8230; [The Amazing Race](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/amazing_race7/) is maybe a little closer to real than those others, but not by much. I want to watch [This is Wonderland](http://www.tv.com/shows/this-is-wonderland/), Tuesdays at 9pm on CBC, or [House](http://www.fox.com/house/) at the same time on Global&#8230; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nope!</span> The roommate has to watch The Amazing Race! Oh well, whatever.

So, I mentioned that [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com) and [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com) were preparing to move into the new house &#8230; That has become reality! Now there&#8217;s a reality show for you &#8230; poor bastards having to pack up their shit and move! What a nightmare! I mean, it worked out pretty well, but what a pain in the ass. You should have seen us pushing and pulling and dragging and shoving that damn couch through the doors. Aaarrgghh! Anyway, they&#8217;re in. Congratulations!

Finally, you&#8217;ll start seeing titles on my Blogs, in preparation for the RSS feed. You&#8217;ve probably already seen the &#8216;edited by Big Cracker&#8217; on some of the Blog responses .. I haven&#8217;t put in any function to delete responses, but I will try to clean them up a bit, if necessary .. So far I&#8217;ve added my own comments or fixed the hyperlinks. crackerMail v1.01 is almost ready, would already be ready if I hadn&#8217;t had computer troubles. It&#8217;s mostly in testing right now, I&#8217;m fixing the reported bugs and adding a little more functionality. The main change for v1.1 is attachments and that&#8217;ll be a little while longer, so I&#8217;m putting together an interim solution.
