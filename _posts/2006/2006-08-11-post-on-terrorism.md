Here I am in [Pearson Airport](http://www.gtaa.com/) in Toronto. I almost connected to the interweb, but couldn&#8217;t be bothered to pay for the access. There&#8217;s some kind of fucked up [Here I am in [Pearson Airport](http://www.gtaa.com/) in Toronto. I almost connected to the interweb, but couldn&#8217;t be bothered to pay for the access. There&#8217;s some kind of fucked up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Ontario_terrorism_plot) on the go here right now and, if you ask me, it&#8217;s fuckin&#8217; ridiculous. &#8220;No liquids or gels on the plane,&#8221; the warning tells me. Fine, I&#8217;ll just pick up a drink once I&#8217;m through [security](http://www.catsa-acsta.gc.ca/). &#8216;Oh no, you won&#8217;t, Big Cracker!&#8217; The drinks fridge at the fuckin&#8217; convenience store is duct-taped shut. The [bottled water](http://www.finewaters.com/Bottled_Water/Canada/Montclair.asp) or [Cokes](http://www.coca-cola.com/) at the restaurants have to be opened and poured into an open cup. Wouldn&#8217;t there be some kind of process in place to make sure the shit that&#8217;s sold within a secured area is secure? Fuck! I&#8217;m left with an apple and 3 granola bars for when I&#8217;m on the plane. What a shitty way to start a vacation.

Oh well, although I won&#8217;t retract my Fuckin&#8217; TTC posts, it was excellent to hop on the bus outside work and ride it right into the airport. No limo, no cab, no trying to find someone to drive me, no fighting traffic. Just sit down, listen to the ol&#8217; [Walkman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiniDisc)Â <del>(mine&#8217;s a couple of years older)</del> and wait an hour. Yeah, an hour, but like the traffic would&#8217;ve been much different!
