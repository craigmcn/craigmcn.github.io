I don&#8217;t know, it seemed like a good title. There was nothing magic about the weekend, though. I managed to get a giant obstacle out of the way on crackerMail v2.0. I have a development version for [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) to test, on which I just found a new problem this morning. It&#8217;s actually an old problem that I thought I had fixed, but I&#8217;ll sort it out tonight. The big obstacle wasÂ in preserving attachments on forwarding and adding attachments to messages. I had already made it possible to download attachments, but not add them and not forward them. Way to go, Big Cracker! [pats self on back]

Other than that, I headed out to the [Bier Markt](http://www.thebiermarkt.com/) for dinner with AN and his colleague, JM. It was a little pricey, but the food was very good and the menu was tastefully varied. I had the [venison tournedos](http://www.thebiermarkt.com/food.php), which was delicious, although the portion was a little small. There was a &#8220;summer squash cloaked canneloni&#8221; that was quite tasty and different. As can be expected, the beer menu was extensive and it was difficult to choose. I settled for a [Tennent&#8217;s](http://www.tennents.com/) lager (Scotland) and AN for an [Erdinger](http://www.erdinger.de/en/erdinger-weissbier-company/brewery.html).

AN tried once again to convince me to move out to [Cowtown](http://www.tourismcalgary.com/), which has crossed my mind a few times. But I&#8217;m not sure I want to work for the benefit of the oil and gas industry. There&#8217;s lots of opportunities, if you can find an affordable place to live.
