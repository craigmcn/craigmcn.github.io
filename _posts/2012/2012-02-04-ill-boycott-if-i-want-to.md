Somebody asked if I planned to try the [new lattes](http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/menu/menu_products.html "Tim Hortons Flavoured Lattes") that are on offer. I answered in the negative, not because I’m some sort of coffee snob (I drink Tim’s coffee every now and again), but because I prefer the [handcrafted beverages](http://www.starbucks.com/menu "Starbucks handcrafted beverages") at Starbucks.

While on the topic, someone else asked if I had tried a particular coffee house and bakery in my neighbourhood, to which I replied in the negative again, with clarification. This particular coffee house and bakery is closed Sundays and Mondays, “to maintain family values”. Okay. Whatever. Be closed, but don’t preach to me at the same time. I feel I’m being judged on my own family values, just because I showed up on a Sunday.

I was told that I shouldn’t boycott the place just for that reason; the coffee and baking is really excellent. Unfortunately, I’ll never find out whether the products are good, because I’ll never go there.

What if my religion dictated that I not work on Tuesday, would someone accept that my store’s closed on Tuesday? Maybe. But would they care that I’m closed for religious or “family values” reasons? Probably not. You want to be closed, be closed. You want to be closed to attend church, be closed. You want to attend church and still be open, hire someone who doesn’t attend church. You don’t want to hire someone who doesn’t go church, I think there may be a human rights issue, but whatever, be closed. But I don’t care why, and I don’t need you to tell me.

I can hold a grudge and I will. They can change the sign and change the policy, but I’m soured. And I’ll stay that way and I’ll like it.
