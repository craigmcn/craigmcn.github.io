No, I haven&#8217;t discovered the [principle of buoyancy;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy) that&#8217;s still [Archimedes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes#Discoveries_and_inventions). But I have found a new [show called Eureka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_(U.S._TV_series)) and it&#8217;s super-duper good.

I was flipping through [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/)&#8216;s [Sci-fi](http://www.scifi.com/) magazine on the weekend and ran across an article discussing the show. It seemed like fun, so I downloaded [Season 1](http://www.tv.com/shows/eureka/season-1/).

It&#8217;s about a secret town called Eureka where basically all the residents are super-geniuses and the main employer is a super-genius, super-secret research lab. A U.S. Marshal stumbles across the town when his car breaks down. He helps solve a weird disappearance and the sheriff (played by ever-popular [Maury Chaykin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001999/)) basically recruits him as the new sheriff. Hilarity and mayhem ensue.

It&#8217;s fun and smart and I like it a lot. Check it out, if you get a chance.
