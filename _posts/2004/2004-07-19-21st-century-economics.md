I would like someone to explain 21<sup>st</sup>-century economics to me. I mean, does a CD really need to cost $25 or more? I went looking for <a href="http://xmadmx.com/" target="_blank">Melissa Auf der Maur</a>&#8216;s new album (which I found, woo hoo, &#8216;Beast of Honor&#8217; is excellent, <a title="Melissa Auf der Maur – Auf der Maur" href="/melissa-auf-der-maur.html" target="_blank">see the review</a>), and happened to take a look at some other albums I was in the market for. _Auf Der Maur_ was $26.99 (marked down to $16.99), <a href="http://www.michellebranch.net/" target="_blank">Michelle Branch</a>&#8216;s _Hotel Paper_ $27.99, <a href="http://www.thehip.com/" target="_blank">The Tragically Hip</a> _In Violet Light_ was $18.99. Is this reasonable? I can&#8217;t wait around and hope that somebody puts these albums on sale for $15, or on a 2 for $20 or $30 rack. I want to be able to buy my music when I want it for a reasonable price. Hello downloading! I feel bad about it. I wanted Melissa Auf der Maur&#8217;s album, so I bought it. I wanted Liz Phair&#8217;s album, so I bought it. I want Michelle Branch, The Hip, <a href="http://www.metallica.com/" target="_blank">Metallica</a>, <a href="http://www.garbage.com/" target="_blank">Garbage</a>, <a href="http://www.matthewgood.org/" target="_blank">Matthew Good</a>, <a href="http://www.billytalent.com" target="_blank">Billy Talent</a> &#8230; but even at \$20 each, no thanks.

The other thing about 21<sup>st</sup>-century economics I need to know is why my pay doesn&#8217;t go up when my cost of living goes up? The Government of Ontario is taking more money from me in Health premiums, generally things I buy are more expensive, so I pay more PST and GST, and where&#8217;s my extra money to cover these things? If anything, I can look forward to a lower pay grade since my employer is looking to consolidate and re-organize operations. Yay?

But, I managed to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387412/" target="_blank">Some Kind of Monster</a>, the documentary about the making of Metallica&#8217;s latest album, St. Anger. It also covers the healing process that Metallica had to go through to be able to sit down together and make an album. Cool. And I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/" target="_blank">I, Robot</a>. I&#8217;d really like to read <a href="http://www.asimovonline.com/" target="_blank">Isaac Asimov</a>&#8216;s short story collection of the same name to see just where the story comes from &#8230; and whether the movie follows it to any extent. Pretty good.
