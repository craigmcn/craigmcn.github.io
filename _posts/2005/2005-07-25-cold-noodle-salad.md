Whew! What a week! I was soooo busy, I didn&#8217;t get a chance to blog! (Well, not really, but it&#8217;s a good excuse.)

So, what made it busy, you ask? Let me tell you &#8230; **Tuesday** evening was a nice quiet dinner with [h! is for Hulk](http://www.ppfhouse.com/art.php). It was a cold noodle salad with anise, cucumber, cold chicken and a peanut sauce. Then we were going to go to [Crash](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375679/) at the Paradise Cinema, but we decided instead to see [Charlie and the Chocolate Factory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367594/). Wow! What a good movie! That [Johnny Depp](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000136/) can do anything. I mean, I&#8217;ve seen [Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669/), [Edward Scissorhands](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099487/), even [21 Jump Street](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092312/). He can pull off any character he wants.

**Wednesday** was a nice quiet evening at home shooting things &#8230; that is, some multiplayer [CoD](http://www.callofduty.com/) with [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/). **Thursday** was a nice dinner with &#8216;Leeeza, RLP and h! down at [Pho Hung](http://phohung.ca/locations.html) on Bloor, right beside [Gabby&#8217;s](http://www.gabbys.ca/). Then some after-dinner drinks at the [Ballroom](http://www.theballroom.ca/). **Friday** night was dinner at Gwildor and [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/)&#8216;s, finished by a rousing game of [Settlers](http://www.catan.com/). (I wasn&#8217;t going to mention getting a full cup of coffee spilled on me, but there you go, now you know. I was prepped to stay the night, so the clothes went right into the washer and were cleaned.) **Saturday** morning and into the afternoon was spent staining G & T&#8217;s back patio. We had a quick game of Settlers that I won, yay! Then the evening was topped off with a [Good Charlotte](http://www.goodcharlotte.com/) concert down at the [Molson Amphitheater](http://www.molsonamphitheatre.net/). What a good show. Although, I keep forgetting that teeny-boppers can scream like crazy when the band asks them to!

I spent Sunday relaxing mostly. I played a little [MxO](http://www.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/) and came within centimetres of finishing the last planned page for [ppfhouse.com](http://www.ppfhouse.com/). (I&#8217;ll finish it tonight, h!, I swear!)
