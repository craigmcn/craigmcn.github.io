So I downloaded an [Apple IIe emulator](http://applewin.berlios.de/) yesterday and played [Oregon Trail](http://www.classicgaming.com/rotw/otrail.shtml). What a good time!! Except my [party of five](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108894/) (not really from the show, I just happened to have 5 people in my wagon; I thought the link would be good for a laugh) died long before we got to Oregon. In total, thieves stole 15 oxen from me! 7 of them on the 2nd day!
