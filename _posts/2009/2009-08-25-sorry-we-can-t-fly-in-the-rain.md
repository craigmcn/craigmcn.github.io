Of course, I had to tweet (and now blog) the [CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/news/) story about the [space shuttle launch being scrubbed](http://www.cbc.ca/technology/story/2009/08/24/nasa-discovery.html). Umm, seriously, &#8220;rain and lightning near the launch site&#8221;? Are you kidding me? This is a vehicle that travels at ridiculous speeds through the atmosphere and into outer space, but not in the rain? The folks over at NASA are the experts at flying in outer space. How is it not possible for them to have built a vehicle that can also fly in the rain? At the same time, this is the 21<sup>st</sup> century, why am I not out there flying my own personal space ship in outer space, to visit my friends on the moon, or for a short vacation on Mars? What is happening to the dream of the 1940s?
