This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Fade To Black_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fade_to_Black_(song)) by [Metallica](http://metallica.com/) from their 1984 album, [Ride the Lightning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_the_Lightning). The [Vitamin String Quartet](https://www.vitaminstringquartet.com/pages/about-us) version is from their 2001 album, [Say Your Prayers Little One: The String Tribute to Metallica](https://www.vitaminstringquartet.com/collections/albums/products/say-your-prayers-little-one-string-tribute-to-metallica).

I couldn't find an official video, so I used the live video that seemed to be from a slightly official source.
