Okay, you have to check this out &#8230; [The Ottawa Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMQzcbCVdqA). It takes some time to load, and I&#8217;m not sure if you&#8217;ll need RealPlayer, but if you can, listen, it&#8217;s HI-larious! I gotta find out where Wublub picked it up &#8230; presumably from Mix 99.9. (It starts with a &#8216;Humble and Fred&#8217; intro.)

Oh, wait, here it is &#8230; [Humble and Fred](http://www.humbleandfred.com/) in the Morning. Too funny.

And, if you didn&#8217;t notice, the Round 1 playoff stats are off to the left. Explain to me why I can&#8217;t find the playoff stats on <a href="http://www.nhl.com" target="_blank">NHL.com</a>. I had to go to <a href="http://www.tsn.ca" target="_blank">TSN.ca</a> and still had to look around a bit.

Had a great time with Nana on Saturday, we went through a tonne of old photos and photo albums. I can&#8217;t believe that she can tell me the story that goes along with photos from 1934 and 1944 &#8230; incredible. There&#8217;s some great pics of my sister in 1984 &#8230; HA HA HA!

And, of course, Uncle Peter stuffed me to overflowing with ham, scalloped potatoes, etc, and, of course, pecan pie &#8230; and coconut cream this time, too. DE-licious! But, man, I don&#8217;t really need all that food. I&#8217;m thinking that once this last wisdom tooth is out at the end of the week, it&#8217;s time for a bit of a diet and some exercise.
