I released a beta version of crackerMail 2.0 this morning and already I&#8217;ve had a couple of reports of bugs. They were primarily minor annoyances, but one is a major loss of functionality in the [Opera browser](http://www.opera.com/). Crappy. Anyway, the beta is ready and the final version (barring any reports of other major bugs) will be out Nov 1. Have fun!
