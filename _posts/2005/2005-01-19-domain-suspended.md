A quick blog today to apologize for the site being down this morning. A slight problem with renewing the domain. Can you believe it&#8217;s been a year since I fired this puppy up? So, the domain renewal was due today. I was sent the bill yesterday. I paid it this morning. Yet, since the renewal wasn&#8217;t done prior to today, the domain was suspended this morning. What a solid pain in the ass!

Anyway, nothing else special. Except I&#8217;ll say a quick hello to the receptionist at my dentist&#8217;s office. (I apologize, I don&#8217;t remember your name.) I went in after work to let them know of my mailing and email address change. She laughed at my new email address, @bigcracker.ca, and said she had to check out the site. I have an appointment in about a month, so I&#8217;ll let everyone know about Big Cracker&#8217;s Trip to the Dentist!
