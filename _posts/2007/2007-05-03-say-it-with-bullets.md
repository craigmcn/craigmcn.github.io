I just finished reading my second [Hard Case Crime](http://www.hardcasecrime.com/) novel, _[Say It with Bullets](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/search/ref=pd_lpo_ix_dp_go_us_ca_en?keywords=say%20it%20with%20bullets&tag=lpo%5Fixdpgouscaen-20&index=blended)_ by [Richard Powell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_P._Powell). The first novel was _[The Colorado Kid](http://www.hardcasecrime.com/books_bios.cgi?title=The%20Colorado%20Kid)_ by [Stephen King](http://www.stephenking.com/). Because I&#8217;m a giant Stephen King fan, I figured I had to check out the book. And because it was pretty good, I thought I check out some others in the Hard Case Crime series.

This was alright. And just alright. Written in [1953](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953), the story is about Bill Wayne, a guy who got screwed over by his friends and now he&#8217;s seeking revenge. In fact, he plans to visit them, one by one, while on a sightseeing bus tour of the American West, and force them to tell him who screwed him and why. The only problem is, and this isn&#8217;t part of the story really, Bill is a big tool. He&#8217;s kind of an asshole and kind of a wimp. When he visits the first friend, he comes with a big .45 [semi-automatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol), but then beats the guy up, the guy turns the tables and knocks Bill unconscious. _Uhh, dude? Next time, just shoot the guy._

To make a long story short, Bill gets framed for 3 murders. And the tour guide on the bus tour is this schoolmarm who used to have a giant crush on Bill back in the day. Surprise, surprise, Bill falls for her. But not before he behaves like a giant jackass towards her. And by the time Bill gets everything figured out and saves the day, he&#8217;s been an asshole to every major and minor character, plus most of the bit players, too. I pretty much wanted to reach into the book and punch Bill right in the face. Finally, in the end, Bill figures out who&#8217;s been setting him up and turns the tables and everything works out; in spite of the fact that the hero of the story is a prick and needs a smack upside the head.

5 out of 10 saltines. It was a good read, but Bill Wayne pisses me off.
