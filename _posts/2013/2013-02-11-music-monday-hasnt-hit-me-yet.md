This week&#8217;s instalment is not covers, but a wholly collaborative tribute. The video is from the CBC&#8217;s [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/default.aspx) [Silver Anniversary Concert](http://music.cbc.ca/#/concerts/CBC-Music-Exclusives-The-Blue-Rodeo-Silver-Anniversary-Concert-VideoAudio-2012-10-29)Â with Andy Maize of the [Skydiggers](http://skydiggers.com/) singing [Greg Keelor](http://www.bluerodeo.com/about/gregKeelor.aspx#subtitle_profile)&#8216;s part. I love this song, and being a big Skydiggers fan from way back, I really like Maize&#8217;s different, yet traditional interpretation of the song. And forgive CBC&#8217;s spelling mistake on the initial title when the song starts.
