This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Video Killed The Radio Star_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Killed_the_Radio_Star) by
[The Buggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buggles) from their 1980 album,
[The Age of Plastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Plastic). The [Walk Off the Earth](https://www.walkofftheearth.com/)
version is from a 2019 video featuring [Sarah Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Silverman).

So technically not the Buggles’ original, but close enough.
