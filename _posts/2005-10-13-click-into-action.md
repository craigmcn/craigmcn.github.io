We know that poverty exists in our own Canadian backyard. On October 17, the [United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty](http://www.un.org/en/events/povertyday/), [Make Poverty History](http://www.makepovertyhistory.ca) will be focusing on the sad reality of child poverty in Canada.

Fifteen years ago the House of Commons unanimously resolved to **&#8220;seek to achieve the goal of eliminating poverty among Canadian children by the year 2000.&#8221;** Yet still more than one million Canadian kids, thatâ€™s one in six, remains poor.

Join us on October 17th to do what you can to end child poverty in Canada.

Write Minister of Finance Ralph Goodale, Minister of Social Development Ken Dryden, and your own Member of Parliament, urging them to End Child Poverty in Canada now. <del>[Go to www.makepovertyhistory.ca to send your letter or see a sample and send yours from your own email program]</del>
