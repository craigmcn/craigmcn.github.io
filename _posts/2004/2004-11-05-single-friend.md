HAHAHAHA &#8230; Funny thing last night at class&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned about a couple of people trying to find me a lady, well now there&#8217;s a third. One of the girls in my class asked me if I was single, then asked if I was comfortable with blind dates. It turns out (surprise, surprise) she has a single friend who&#8217;s my age. I told her I&#8217;d think about it. I&#8217;m still not too sure &#8230; I guess it couldn&#8217;t hurt, really, but I&#8217;m not sure what my plans are right now, so I&#8217;m not sure I really want to confuse things further. I don&#8217;t know, we&#8217;ll see.

Other than that, we&#8217;re a lot further along in finishing the Externalgateway.com site. We should have a &#8216;Grand Opening&#8217; within the next few weeks &#8230; right, Gw? Well, again, we&#8217;ll see.
