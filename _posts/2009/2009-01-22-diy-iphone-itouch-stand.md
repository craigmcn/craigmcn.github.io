True, this is not a [do-it-yourself (DIY)](http://www.google.ca/search?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&=&q=do-it-yourself+DIY&btnG=Google+Search&meta=lr%3D) blog. That&#8217;s mostly because, while I often do things myself (rather than opt for a pre-packaged solution), I&#8217;m not handy enough to do it regularly. But I subscribe to the [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) [RSS](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_(file_format)>) [feed](http://lifehacker.com/index.xml) and I often run across interesting tidbits of DIY savvy. This morning, for example, I found the &#8220;[Landscape iPhone Stand from Pencils and Rubber Bands](http://lifehacker.com/5136883/create-a-landscape-iphone-stand-from-pencils-and-rubber-bands),&#8221; courtesy [Geeky Gadgets](http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/?p=9620). I don&#8217;t have an [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/) nor an [iTouch](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipodtouch/) (also known as the iPod Touch; _plug, plug, when do I get paid?_), but I thought this was kind of a cool thing. I suppose if you have any unit (e.g., iPod, index cards, recipe cards) about the same size, you could use the same kind of stand.
