Well, still no new editorial for y&#8217;all, but I&#8217;ll at least blog something, since it&#8217;s been almost a week.

I&#8217;m feeling pretty good without the tooth, but the mouth is still a little sore. It&#8217;s a weird sort of tension, it&#8217;s kind of hard to describe. I feel like I&#8217;ve got stuff stuck in my teeth, but there&#8217;s nothing there.

No big news, nothing to really link to&#8230; Oh, well, yay <a href="http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/" target="_blank">LEAFS</a>!! I&#8217;ll cut some slack to all the <a href="http://www.ottawasenators.com/" target="_blank">Sens</a> fans out there, Ottawa was definitely the better team in the series. But that Eddie Belfour can sure stop that puck! Yeah, yeah, I&#8217;m in <a href="http://www.toronto.com" target="_blank">TO</a>, so I&#8217;ll be a good boy and root for the Leafs. With nobody blocking for Belfour and their dump-the-puck offence, beating <a href="http://www.philadelphiaflyers.com/" target="_blank">Philly</a> is not gonna be easy.

I&#8217;m trying to keep up with <a href="http://www.tsn.ca/" target="_blank">TSN</a>&#8216;s changes on the Playoff board, so things may go funny every now and then with the playoff stats on the left. I think it&#8217;ll be good for another couple weeks, &#8217;til Round 3 gets posted.

Anyway, that&#8217;s it for me for another day &#8230; Luvs ya!!
