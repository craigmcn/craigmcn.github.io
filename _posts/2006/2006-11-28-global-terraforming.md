In an article [complementary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/complementary) to [An Inconvenient Truth](http://www.climatecrisis.net/), [Jamais Cascio](http://www.openthefuture.com/jamais.html) discusses a very dangerous alternative to altering our current carbon dioxide emissions: [terraforming](http://worldchanging.com/archives/003121.html).Â  Rather than worry about the damage we&#8217;re doing right now, he discusses the option of spending the time and money, in the future, to alter the atmosphere. It&#8217;s an interesting concept and a good bandwagon to jump on for the denialists: &#8220;It&#8217;s not really a problem and it&#8217;s not really our fault, but if it turns into a problem, we&#8217;ll find a bigger way to fix it.&#8221; An interesting proposition, I&#8217;m glad that Jamais isn&#8217;t promoting it as viable.
