You know what I like? I like walking to the bus stop and seeing someone already there. I like it because it&#8217;s sort of like having an extra person doing your waiting for you. It means that I didn&#8217;t just miss the bus and have to wait 10 minutes for the next one, someone else has done some of that 10 minutes of waiting already.

Hmmm &#8230; blogs are supposed to have links &#8230;. uhhh .. okay: <http://www.ttc.ca/> &#8230; it&#8217;s bus-related. Well, [here&#8217;s another one](http://youtu.be/GL5l3k7vBsk).
