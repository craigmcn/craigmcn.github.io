I am so tired! Tired of work, tired of not sleeping long enough &#8230; oh man! Oh well, whatever, I bring it on myself, really.

You all got the weekend story, now is the equally eventful weekday story. Monday I went to a spoken word show at [The Trane Studio](http://www.tranestudio.com/history/). ProACTIVE Words was hosted by [Simonee Chichester](http://myfriendsimonee.com/) and all the proceeds went to her Outta the Box grant project. <del>(Her website appears to be one big Flash presentation, so you&#8217;ll need to surf around a bit to see all the information.)</del> The artists who performed were Melanie Janisse (poetry reading), Simonee Chichester (storytelling), Hajile Kalaike (lyrical prose), Elisha Lim (political discussion), [Amanda Hiebert](http://www.tumf.net/poetryslam_bios/Amanda_Hiebert.phtml) (slam poetry) and [LEO37](http://www.ppfhouse.com/leo37/) with Al Buddy Black (acapella rap/hip-hop). It was a very interesting and thought-provoking show, although Amanda Hiebert&#8217;s enthusiasm scared the pants off me! I got home late and still had to go to work!

Tuesday was my birthday &#8230;. **Happy Birthday to me!** I wanted a pretty toned-down affair and sort of got it. Because I was out Monday and planned to be out again Wednesday, and I knew that my family would be calling me, I thought I might stay home and relax. Well, I mentioned to [h! is for Hulk](http://www.ppfhouse.com/art.php) Monday night that it was my birthday and he decided we **had** to do _something_. So I played around with the new laptop and then headed over to h&#8217;s brother&#8217;s place for cake, [Rockstar: INXS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Star:_INXS) and [Goldeneye](http://www.gamespot.com/goldeneye-007/). Funny story about the cake: the woman at the Portuguese bakery wouldn&#8217;t write &#8216;cracker&#8217; on it, so they just got a blank (yet fancily decorated) cake. I didn&#8217;t end up talking to the fam&#8230; I usually have the cell phone forwarded into the house, but had it unforwarded during the day, I forgot to forward it back into the house and left it in my bag on vibrate, so I never heard it! Bad Cracker!! And, again, another late night!

I&#8217;m tired again just writing this! Last night, out again! This time to the Rex for [The Worst Pop Band Ever](http://www.ppfhouse.com/music/wpbe/). What a good time! They played some original stuff and some jazz-flavoured pop tunes: [Army of Me](http://www.bjork.com/#/past/discography/post/track1/lyrics1), [Everybody Wants to Rule the World](http://www.last.fm/music/Tears+for+Fears/_/Everybody+Wants+To+Rule+The+World), [Secret Journey](http://www.last.fm/music/The+Police/_/Secret+Journey), [The Wreck of the Edmund Fizgerald](http://www.corfid.com/gl/wreck.htm). I only managed to stay for the first 2 sets, because it was late and I had to work! But it was good stuff &#8230; h! even had the ol&#8217; laptop out doing some recording of the show.

And [thanks to Joey Jack](/big-cracker-goes-mobile.html) (WARNING &#8211; SPOILERS!!), I know what [War of the Worlds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407304/) is all about! Thanks, buddy!
