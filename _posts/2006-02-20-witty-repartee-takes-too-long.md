So I had a great blog written for today, but my browser timed out and killed it before I finished posting. What&#8217;s here is missing a lot of the witty repartee that I&#8217;d written.

I&#8217;d made some comment about it being Monday and not being able to think of a good title for a Monday blog, except to quote <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Monday-Monday-lyrics-The-Mamas-the-Papas/B6C30A6352116D5148256BB900148656">Monday, Monday</a> by [the Mamas and the Papas](http://mpinfo.davidredd.com/). Then I thought <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Manic-Monday-lyrics-The-Bangles/9ED9658EEEDA61FC4825697D003210D0">Manic Monday</a> by [the Bangles](http://www.thebangles.com/discography.html) might be the way to go, but &#8220;Six o&#8217;clock already &#124; I was just in the middle of a dream &#124; I was kissin&#8217; Valentino &#124; By a crystal blue Italian stream&#8221; isn&#8217;t really my style. If anything, my alarm doesn&#8217;t go off until 6:30, and I snooze it a couple of times first.

Also, yours truly fully [skunked](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/skunk#Verb)—<del>see definition 3, which is also a verb</del>—[Big Gwilly](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/), [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com/) and JAC (Trikie&#8217;s sister) in a rousing game of SceneIt! Music edition. It was pretty much a shutout, it was sad. Although I was disappointed that I didn&#8217;t guess [Jim Morrison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Morrison) from his junior high school yearbook photo in a &#8220;Rising Stars&#8221; question. (Yes, I&#8217;m a huge Doors fan!)

We played after a delicious dinner of lamb chops, roasted potatoes and steamed mixed veggies that JAC prepared. There was a bucketload of whinging about the amount of food, to the extent that JAC volunteered to [order a pizza](http://www.dominos.ca/), which was completely unnecessary. She also fed us a very yummy, nutty cranberry-walnut loaf and black coffee. Well, it was my choice to consume the black coffee, which was very nice. JAC only had [rice milk](http://www.answers.com/topic/rice-milk) or cream, and I&#8217;m a hardcore 1% or skim milk man.

In other news, I was a little disappointed by Daddy-O&#8217;s reaction to the work I&#8217;ve done on a website for a conference he&#8217;s helping to organise (yes, with an &#8216;s&#8217;, in the manner of the British). I built a shiny HTML registration form that when submitted produces a PDF document with all the registrant&#8217;s information ready for printing or saving &#8230; &#8220;Huh, okay.&#8221; That&#8217;s it? It was a lot of work, and I need [a special PHP class](http://www.fpdf.org/) to do it! Well, whatever. It looks pretty and I&#8217;m happy!
