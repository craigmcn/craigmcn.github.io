I&#8217;ve mentioned my [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/) addiction before, and I think I have it under control. But I happened across a friend of a friend and found that she was in a group called [The Great Global Warming Swindle](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2259278396&ref=nf). WTF? You gotta be shitting me!

I don&#8217;t pretend to know what I&#8217;m talking about in this case, so I&#8217;m not going to argue against the science. Maybe climate change is entirely natural. Glaciers have receded before, why not again now? The mean temperature of the earth decreased substantially in the early part of the last millenium, why not warm up a bit now? Sure. Fine. Why not?

My problem is that the main symptoms of atmospheric carbon dioxide is not so much the &#8220;global warming&#8221; but the **pollution**. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is not the tidy clean CO<sub>2</sub> that plants use and people exhale. It&#8217;s dirty, nasty shit that makes the sky brown.

If climate change arguments are a &#8220;swindle&#8221;, maybe think about reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in terms of clean air and water. Maybe think about driving your car less and walking for awhile, I think we could all use a little more exercise. Maybe think about public transit as a way to avoid traffic congestion. Maybe quit being a whiny ass and do something for a friggin&#8217; change.
