Just to let you know, I updated the [Blog Response](/system-update.html#respond "System update") function here on bigcracker.ca to ensure that even unsuccessful responses get posted.

[VeeDub](http://projectkr.blogspot.com/) mentioned awhile ago that his &#8220;response was **not** posted successfully,&#8221; but he wasn&#8217;t going to retry. If the response was &#8220;unsuccessful&#8221; it was not inserted into the database. Unfortunately, once it&#8217;s unsuccessful, it&#8217;s a challenge to go back and do it again, especially from an [iTouch](http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/). Originally, my system sent an email when a response was posted (i.e., successful), but I&#8217;ve now modified it to email me even with unsuccessful posts. I&#8217;ve added some fun things to try to ensure that whatever stopped the response from being written to the database will not affect the email. We&#8217;ll see what happens!

**Update:** Thanks to [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) for some impromptu testing. F&#8212; you! ðŸ™‚
