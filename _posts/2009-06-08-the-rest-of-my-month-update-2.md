What&#8217;s been going on for the last week, you ask? Good question. I&#8217;ve got a to-do list for today that&#8217;s a page and a half in my notebook, with a bunch of stuff left over from last week; that&#8217;s something. I got a haircut at Haarley&#8217;s Salon; that&#8217;s something. I had beers with my good buddy Kev; that&#8217;s something else. And I&#8217;ve worked a few shifts at [the SB](http://starbucks.ca/); something else again.

Work? Oh yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m supposed to be doing. I&#8217;m still at it. I&#8217;ve done some work on the [Western Cities Conference](http://westerncitiesconference.ca/) website and my own site, as well as blogging on The Tech Writer Blog website. I&#8217;ve also been following a bunch of people on Twitter. The Twitter thing is to get more info and more ideas for stuff to do.

The novel is coming along slowly. I still haven&#8217;t decided where to put up info for you guys to see, but I&#8217;ll get there. I&#8217;m going to post some character descriptions that are partly ready. I also want to find somewhere that will buy (even for a small price) some short stories about some of my minor characters. I&#8217;m going to try to pump those out as practice.

Again, if you have any ideas for stuff I should look into or try out, [let me know](mailto:craig@craigmcn.ca).
