Okay, I&#8217;m in the middle of this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.macleans.ca" target="_blank">Maclean&#8217;s</a> and there&#8217;s a big article about cyberbullying. This is an online phenomenon among school-aged children, bullying others via email, instant messaging or text messaging on cell phones. First of all, I can&#8217;t believe this happens. Well, I guess I can, but I mean, what happened to going outside and playing? Even when I started getting bullied &#8212; I can&#8217;t even really call it &#8220;bullied&#8221; &#8212; when I fell out of favour with people who had been my friends, I simply started hanging out more with other friends. The old friends found it humourous to make prank phone calls to my house, but we were kids, that&#8217;s what happens. I know it wasn&#8217;t really personal. And eventually, we grew up &#8230; although we still don&#8217;t talk, and I never intend to &#8230; I can really hold a grudge.

But do kids have absolutely nothing better to do than send nasty emails to other kids? Really, go to the playground and push other kids down, steal their bikes, don&#8217;t let them play kickball with you, but email, come on. And to those being bullied, dish it back. Obviously, these people aren&#8217;t comfortable abusing you in public, so you&#8217;re pretty safe. Or just ignore them, the attacks aren&#8217;t really personal.

And either way, if you&#8217;re being bullied, regardless of physically or mentally, online or in public, let your parents know. And parents, don&#8217;t take away the computer or cell phone, the kids live on these things. Teach them to defend themselves or ignore it &#8230; if they&#8217;re becoming depressed, talk to them, reinforce their self-confidence. If it gets out-of-hand, like death threats or actual physical intimidation, call the police.
