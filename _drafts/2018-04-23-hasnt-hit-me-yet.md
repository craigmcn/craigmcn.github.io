This week’s instalment of Music Monday is [_Hasn’t Hit Me Yet_](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/five-days-in-july/) by [Blue Rodeo](http://www.bluerodeo.com/) from their 1993 album, [Five Days in July](http://www.bluerodeo.com/discography/five-days-in-july/). I thought this 2016 live performance was a brilliant display of how consistent the band’s been for 25 years. I even like [Colin Cripps’](http://www.colincripps.com/) solo.
