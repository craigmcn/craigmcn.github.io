Well, a new year it is, and I finally (today) got my Xmas/New Year&#8217;s form letters emailed out, in lieu of Xmas cards. I spent last night with <a href="http://gwild0r.tumblr.com" target="_blank">Gwildor</a> and Trikie, for an evening of fondue and games. Well, and cocktails, too. I had a good time, anyway.

The only other note today, it&#8217;s my Mommy&#8217;s birthday. Happy Birthday, Mommy.
