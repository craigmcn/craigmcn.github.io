I&#8217;m working on a rebuttal to [Batroc](http://budblog.frymybacon.com/)&#8216;s response to my [Israel-Lebanon post](/the-israel-lebanon-folderol.html), but in the meantime I have to relate a HI-larious discussion we had at work about raisins. It turns out that Cyon and my podmate, Whitby LE, are violently opposed to raisins. Cyon even mentioned that they make him vomit.Â  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever known anyone to voice such strong negative opinion about dried fruit.
