Please don&#8217;tÂ present a question as a statement. &#8220;The status is Read-only and the user cannot modify the data.&#8221; Yes. True. _Read-only_ means the user can _only read_ the information. Thank you and have a good night.

In a sufficiently cowed tone, &#8220;If the user needs to modify the information, what options does he have?&#8221; Ahhh, a question. Thank you. The user can return the document to the originator who can change the status so the user can make the necessary change. &#8220;Oh, good idea, thanks.&#8221; Duh.
