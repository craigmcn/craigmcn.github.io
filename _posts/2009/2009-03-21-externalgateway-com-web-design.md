While I probably should have consulted [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com/) about it, I just finished re-designing the Externalgateway.com website. It was originally really image- and table-laden, so I created a minimalist design that is entirely CSS-based. Well, except for the tabular structures that, by definition, required tables. I hope you like it. (And Gwildor, don&#8217;t kill me!)
