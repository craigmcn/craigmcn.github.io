A litle late, but better than never &#8230; I went out to see [The Departed](http://thedeparted.warnerbros.com/) Saturday with [h!](http://ppfhouse.com/news/) and RLP. Shuttergirl was in the cinema, but she went to see [Infamous](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420609/) with Wild Erbunch.

The Departed was good, but not necesarily great. [Leonardo DiCaprio](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000138/) was surprisingly good; he&#8217;s come a long way from the homeless orphan on [Growing Pains](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088527/). While a few people have mentioned flashbacks to The Shining when watching Jack Nicholson, I didn&#8217;t feel he was quite as intense as he usually is (&#8220;[You can&#8217;t handle the truth!](http://www.whysanity.net/monos/fewgood.html)&#8220;). Due to the surprise, twist ending, I don&#8217;t want to go into detail about it, but it was very good. And very apt, given the nature of the people involved. Definitely worth seeing, in the theatre.
