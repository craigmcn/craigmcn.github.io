Okay, I have to admit, I don&#8217;t understand people. First, from Smokey&#8217;s comment on the [last blog](/the-strangest-one-of-all.html), I&#8217;m pretty sure the girl wasn&#8217;t looking for any Cracker action, and if she was, she went about it all wrong. Obviously, I&#8217;m clueless. But I had a further experience, on the bus, that has fully confused me.

A girl rang the bell to get off the bus. She stood up and walked over to the back door. The bus came to the stop, she got off. A dude sitting close to the door then stood up, arranged his pack on his back, got a solid hold on his guitar case and slowly meandered over to the door. By the time he stepped down to get off the bus, of course the bus was moving again. He got visibly upset, rang the bell and loudly asked the driver to let him off. When the driver stopped the bus, he still didn&#8217;t open the back doors, so the guy huffed and puffed his way to the front door, where he had to ask again that the driver let him off.

Now, I was there. I saw what happened. At no time from the girl ringing the bell, through getting off the bus, to the dude being at the back door was there any indication that the dude wanted to get off at that particular stop. He made no effort to get himself ready before the bus stopped, and made no effort to hurry up while the bus was stopped. And yet, he was visibly angry when the driver pulled away from the stop without him gettting off.

Dude, when the bus stops, you should already be at the door. For the sake of every other passenger, get your ass in gear. I don&#8217;t want to imagine how long a bus ride would have to be if the driver had to confirm at every stop that everyone considering getting out at that stop was out. Hmmm, maybe the driver should just stop at every stop, and ask if anyone wants to get out, just in case you forget to ring the bell.

Oh, yeah, and considering [Ebert & Roeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Movies_(U.S._TV_series)) gave [Just Friends](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433400/) two-thumbs down (Ebert gave it 1 out of 4 stars in [his own column](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051122/REVIEWS/51120001/1001)), it still managed to hit number 3 (behind the top two movies of last weekend) this weekend.. Just shows that while reviewers may know good from bad, audiences don&#8217;t care.
