Ho-Lee Crizzzzap!! What have I been doing for the last week and change?! I look at this site everyday &#8230; no word of a lie, <span style="font-weight: bold;">every</span> day &#8230; And still I haven&#8217;t blogged in over a week. But, to be fair (at least a little bit), I <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> been busy. I posted something last Friday, played the [Matrix Online](http://www.gamespot.com/the-matrix-online/)Â Saturday, went to 2 movies Sunday, played more Matrix Monday and Tuesday, went over to h! is for Hulk&#8217;s for dinner Wednesday and to workout his [fancy-schmancy new website](http://www.ppfhouse.com/), tried to watch [CSI](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/) and [ER](http://www.tv.com/shows/er/) Thursday, but Tigerrage was watching [The Apprentice](http://www.nbc.com/nbc/The_Apprentice/), Friday I went to the [Collins Brewhouse](http://www.collinsbrewhouse.ca/) for Wublub&#8217;s birthday bash, Saturday more work on the fancy-schmancy website then over to [Gwildor](http://gwild0r.tumblr.com) and [Trikie](http://trikie.tripod.com)&#8216;s for Gwildor&#8217;s birthday bash, and Sunday (after getting home from Gwil&#8217;s, since nobody could drive for all the [Mudshakes](http://www.independentdistillers.ca/products/vodka-mudshakes/) and white russians Saturday) finished the main pages for the fancy-schmancy website. Whoo. Yep, that&#8217;s a good week.

Oh, and Wednesday, while over to h! is for Hulk&#8217;s, I got to watch his niece, little C, learn to use a spoon. &#8220;If I hold it this way and cramit into the apple sauce, then cram it into my mouth, I get a little bit of apple sauce. But if I hold it <span style="font-style: italic;">this</span> way and cram it into the apple sauce &#8230; Woo hoo! A <span style="font-weight: bold;">ton</span> of apple sauce!&#8221;

Now that wasn&#8217;t so hard &#8230; what took me all week? Oh, the 2 movies, you ask? Yes, well, [The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/) (very good, and that [Zooey Deschanel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221046/) is sexy!) and [House of Wax](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397065/) (pretty good, and that [Elisha Cuthbert](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0193846/) is sexy!).
