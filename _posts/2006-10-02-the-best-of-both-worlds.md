I would have thought I already had a blog with this same title, but it doesn&#8217;t look like it.

LEGO + Star Wars = Super Mad Fun! I picked up [LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy](http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legostarwarsii/) on Friday and played for a good couple of hours over the weekend. You can&#8217;t beat making [Luke Skywalker](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/lukeskywalker/) build a droid out of LEGO or have [Obi-Wan Kenobi](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/obiwankenobi/) use The Force to turn stairs into a ramp, so that a LEGO [C3P0](http://www.starwars.com/explore/encyclopedia/characters/c3po/) can get onto a ledge (C3P0 can&#8217;t climb stairs). I&#8217;m nowhere near finished and really not that far into it, but it&#8217;s been good times!

In other news (and the reason I&#8217;m not that far along in LEGO Star Wars), I&#8217;ve been putting ridiculous amounts of time into crackerMail v2.0. I&#8217;m on a 3rd development version and testing on the 2nd development version has revealed some [now-corrected] bugs. I promised a guy that I would have a beta version ready by Oct. 15, and I&#8217;m well on my way. The final version is scheduled for Nov. 1. The big improvement is something that has been on my mind since I first developed crackerMail: attachments, adding and removing and forwarding; I&#8217;ve got that part working. There&#8217;s some other fun things, but I&#8217;ve already bored you to tears, so I&#8217;ll leave it alone.
