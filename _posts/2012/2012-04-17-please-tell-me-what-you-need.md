When someone asks me to do something, if they provide no further direction, I trust that it requires no further direction. All too often, that’s a poor assumption.

Forms are my business. Even though I’m not familiar with this nomination form, it must be related to the URL provided earlier in the email.

I can’t seem to find anything other than a PDF and the person making the request could have removed the PDF himself. I must have missed something obvious. I search the website, look through the folders. Nope, no form.
