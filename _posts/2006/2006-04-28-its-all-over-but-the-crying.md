So, now that I&#8217;ve stopped weeping over the betrayal I&#8217;ve suffered at the hands of [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/), I can admit defeat. My 1 in 16 record of wins in the [Rrroll up the Rim](http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/index.php) contest is shameful when the average statistics for the contest are 1 in 9. What&#8217;s more embarrasing is that in 82 coffees I was only able to manage 5 wins &#8230; disgraceful. And I lose the bet with VeeDub. Luckily, it was only for an extra large [double-double](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/story/2004/06/30/doubledouble040630.html).

Anyway, I think next year, I might expand my Rrroll up the Rim script so that anyone can post their results. That way I can keep better track of the whole contest.
