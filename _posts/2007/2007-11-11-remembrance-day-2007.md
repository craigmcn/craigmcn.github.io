Well, here it is, [Remembrance Day](http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/other/remember/r_intro) 2007. I spent 2006 in [Calgary](http://www.tourismcalgary.com/) and 2005 in [Ottawa](http://www.ottawatourism.ca/), so this time I stayed home. Well, in the same city.

I was highly disappointed by the lack of a [bagpiper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagpipe) at the [ceremony at Old City Hall](http://www.toronto.ca/lestweforget/index.htm). There&#8217;s no way it was too cold for a piper, &#8217;cause last year in [Cowtown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowtown) it was waay colder and some poor piper was out there freezin&#8217; his lips off. [Mayor David Miller](http://www.toronto.ca/david_miller/index.htm) made a nice speech and it was all very nice. I didn&#8217;t quite understand the order of the wreath laying, but whatever, I don&#8217;t pay a lot of attention to it in the first place.

I failed to take pictures. My apologies. I was already on the subway and already late by the time I realized that I hadn&#8217;t brought my camera.
