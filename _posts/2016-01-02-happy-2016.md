Happy 2016, everybody! 2015 is past and was quite a year for all of us, I think. I hope it was fulfilling for all of you. I&#8217;m not going to go into all the things that I did, felt, experienced, or that otherwise were part of my life, I&#8217;ll just say that I think 2015 was a good year and I hope to build on it to make 2016 equally good or better.

I&#8217;ll leave you with this video of how I spent New Year&#8217;s Eve. Thanks to [The Worst Pop Band Ever](http://wpbe.ppfhouse.com/) for the soundtrack.
